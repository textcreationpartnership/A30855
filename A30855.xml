            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen I firſt look'd upon the <hi>Title,</hi> and curſorily viewed the Contents of the following Tract, I ſeverely enough <hi>cenſured</hi> in my Thoughts the boldneſs of the Undertaking, and well-nigh <hi>condemned</hi> the <hi>whole Diſcourſe</hi> in my Mind, before I had read any part thereof.

Eternal Torments or the Pains of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned neceſſarily for ever accompany their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Deſires of preferring worldly Vanities before the Enjoyment of God.

The Breach of them is Evil, as it hinders the ſame: and not as it meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly croſſes the Will of the Legiſlator. Every Breach of them is more or leſs Evil, as it is more or leſs prejudicial to the General Good, and has in that reſpect a greater or leſs Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty aſſigned thereunto.

               <p n="1">1. WHatſoever has Perception, the ſame has a Being; for what is not, can have no Perception. And that there is Perception, the very Denyer of it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40186:13"/> (if there be any one ſo vain, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the reſt of Mankind) may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced from his own denyal. For the denyal of it, if the denyer be ſerious, muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from this, that he thinks there is no ſuch thing as Perception; which Thought of his, he cannot otherwiſe chuſe but grant to be either true or falſe; if he grant it to be falſe, he owns in effect there is Percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But in caſe he will have his Thought to be true, he muſt yield that his very Thought it ſelf is a right Perception; and ſo either way he'll be neceſſitated to acknowledg, that there is for certain Perception.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Perception then moſt certainly there is, and conſequently ſomething that perceives, or that has an actual Being which is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Perception. And whatſoever has an actual Being or doth Exiſt, the ſame muſt have it's exiſtence either intrinſecal of it ſelf, or from ſome other thing that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal to it. Whatſoever receives its exiſtence from any thing that is extrinſecal to it, that ſame it not the perfecteſt Being that is, (becauſe it depends upon another for its exiſtence) provided there be any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all, which has nothing of Exiſtence from another.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And that there is ſome Being which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40186:13"/> has nothing of exiſtence from another, is clear from hence, that, ſince the reaſon of a things exiſting by virtue of another, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſome other thing which cauſes it to exiſt; and that an endleſs Series, or infinite number of things cauſing others to exiſt is impoſſible to have been, (becauſe a by-paſt Series of things may be encreaſed by a new addition made unto it, and a Series of things which may be encreaſed is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, for otherwiſe there might be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that would be more, or greater than infinite, which queſtionleſs cannot be) there muſt of neceſſity be ſome firſt cauſe which receives nothing from another, but exiſts wholly of it ſelf, and is thereupon the moſt perfect Being.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That which is the moſt perfect Being or firſt Cauſe, muſt of neceſſity have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways exiſted, or been from Eternity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if there had been a time when it was not, it muſt of nothing have become ſomething, ſeeing it ſelf was firſt. And in caſe it ſhould of nothing have become ſomething, it would have been, or exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before it had a Being, or Exiſtence, and conſequently have been and not have been, or exiſted and not exiſted at once, which is impoſſible. For being ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40186:14"/> to be the firſt Being, if ever it had a Beginning, it muſt have been as well the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer, as the thing to be produced, and ſo as it was the Producer muſt be ſuppoſed to have had a Being, and as it was the thing to be produced, to have had no Being, and both at the ſame Inſtant, which is a manifeſt Contradiction.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The prime or firſt Being then is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily eternal <hi>à parte antè,</hi> and what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily Eternal <hi>à parte antè,</hi> is likewiſe ſo <hi>à parte pòſt,</hi> becauſe having nothing of exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from another (<hi>Paragraph</hi> 3.) it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily exiſt of it ſelf, and what neceſſarily exiſts of it ſelf, has exiſtence eſſential to it; and what has exiſtence eſſential to it, cannot but exiſt, and what cannot but exiſt, doth perpetually exiſt; and conſequently the firſt Being, as it never had a Beginning, ſo ſhall it never have Ending, and that under the neceſſity of a Contradiction to be otherwiſe, ſince neceſſarily and eſſentially to exiſt is to be impoſſible at any time not to exiſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Since then Exiſtence is eſſential to the firſt Being, and that becauſe it is the firſt Being, and has no dependence on another, but exiſts entirely of it ſelf, there are of neceſſity no more Firſt Beings but One. For in caſe we ſhould ſuppoſe there
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40186:14"/> were more Firſt Beings eternally co-exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we muſt grant that exiſtence would be equally eſſential to them all, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that there could be no eſſential difference among them. Neither could it poſſibly be, that they ſhould in any ſort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally differ, becauſe their Exiſtence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſſential (and ſo of neceſſity the very ſame thing throughout with the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial thing exiſting) would have no room, or place, for any accident in them whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. And if there were neither eſſential, nor accidental difference, there could be none at all; for a meer numerical difference without either, is here impoſſible; becauſe, in that, Exiſtence is eſſential to the Firſt Being, it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not from pure formal Exiſtence, and what differs not from pure formal Exiſtence muſt of neceſſity comprehend all exiſtence, or whatever doth or can exiſt; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, if any thing exiſt, or have a Being, which is not within the ſame, it muſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably receive it from thence; ſo that it is plainly impoſſible there ſhould be more firſt Beings ſave one alone.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That there is then one only Firſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is comprehenſive of all Being, is evident. And that the ſame is infinite in Eſſence and Perfection of Being, is no leſs
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40186:15"/> evidently certain, for in caſe it were of a finite Nature, it muſt by ſome means or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be limited, for what has no limitation or bounds, is infinite. And if the Firſt Being be limited, it muſt of neceſſity be limited by it ſelf, by reaſon it alone being before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beings, there could not poſſibly be any thing beſides it ſelf to limit it. And that it ſhould either voluntarily limit it ſelf; or be neceſſarily limited by its own intrinſic Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is impoſſible; for the former cannot be, becauſe Exiſtence being eſſential to it (<hi>par.</hi> 5.) makes it neceſſarily to be, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, eternally; nor can the latter be, becauſe its eſſence being pure formal exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, (<hi>par.</hi> 6.) cannot be intrinſecally li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited or reſtrain'd, by its own Nature, to this or that, or any determinate Mode, or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Exiſtence whatſoever. The Firſt being therefore is infinite in Being, a Perfection of Eſſence (which again farther ſhews, that there is one alone Firſt Being, for being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in Being and Perfection of Eſſence, it has all poſſible Being and Perfection with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſelf; and if it have all, there is none beſides has any but what it receives from it.)</p>
               <p n="8">8. The firſt Being then is neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in Being and Perfection of Eſſence: and what is neceſſarily ſo, cannot poſſibly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40186:15"/> either acquire, or loſe any thing whereby its Perfection can, in any reſpect whatſoever be either augmented, or diminiſhed; and what cannot, in any reſpect whatever, receive either augmentation, or diminution, is wholly immutable, the Firſt Being therefore is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Whatſoever is Immutable has nothing either of Potentiality, or Paſſibility, at all belonging to it, for otherwiſe it would not be impoſſible (as implying no Contradiction) that it ſhould be changed from Power to Act, from Acting to Suffering. And what has nothing at all of Potentiality, or Paſſibility belonging to it, muſt of neceſſity be a pure eſſential Act; the Firſt Being therefore is a pure eſſential Act.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That which is a pure eſſential Act, is void of all manner of Compoſition, for elſe it would have a mixture of ſome ingredient with it. And what is void of all manner of Compoſition is abſolutely Simple; the Firſt Being therefore is abſolutely and altogether Simple.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That which is abſolutely ſimple, has no parts at all, and by conſequence, whatever is contained in it, the ſame is its whole entire Self and Being, and thence one pure Formality; the Firſt Being therefore is one pure Formality.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40186:16"/>12. And what is one pure Formality, has no formally diſtinct Parts, and therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Power, nor Wiſdom, nor Goodneſs, nor Mercy, nor Juſtice, nor any Attribute what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are formally diſtinct in the firſt Being, either from one another, or from its ſelf. (But ſince the prime Being eminently contains whatever excellency is intended by the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes we uſually, for expreſſing our narrow Thoughts by, give unto it, 'tis not incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nor unuſeful, to aſcribe them thereunto.)</p>

And what is ſo abſolutely ſimple, that it has not ſo much as formally diſtinct Parts, muſt neceſſarily be without Parts really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of one another; and what is ſo cannot be corporeal, becauſe a Body conſiſts of Parts really excluſive of one another; and what is not corporeal, is immaterial; and an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Being or Subſtance we call a Spirit; the Firſt Being therefore is a Spirit.</p>
               <p>The total then of all contain'd in this Section ſumm'd up together amounts to this; that there neceſſarily is an abſolutely Perfect Being, which is ſelf-exiſtent, Eternal, only One, Infinite, Immutable, a pure eſſential Act, entirely Simple, one Formality, and a Spirit which we uſually call by the name of GOD.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. II.</hi> In the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Divine Eſſence there neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily is a Trinity of Perſons.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THat there is only one God, has been ſhewn, <hi>Sect. 1. Par.</hi> 6. whoſe Exiſtence becauſe it is eſſential to him (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 5.) by the Eſſence of God is to be underſtood the Eternal Nature, or Being, or Thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting, which is God. For eſſentially to exiſt, is to be neceſſary to exiſt; and to be neceſſary to exiſt, is to be impoſſible not to exiſt; and for a thing to be impoſſible not to exiſt; is to be a thing whoſe Eſſence is pure Exiſtence, or a direct contradiction to Non-Exiſtence. The Divine Eſſence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a Thing, Subſtance or Being, which is a perfect contradictory Repugnancy to Non-Entity, and is God alone himſelf, or the Divine Nature eternally exiſting of it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What is meant by the Divine Eſſence being explain'd, we muſt next conſider what the Word <hi>Perſon,</hi> attributed to God, is intended to denote; and we find it to be this, An incommunicable Subſtance of an intelligent Nature.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:40186:17"/>3. Eſſence and Perſon thus explicated, in regard God is one pure eſſential Act, and entirely ſimple Being (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 9, 10.) it is impoſſible there ſhould be any Plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Diſtinction of Perſons in God, unleſs God himſelf be ſome way differently related to and within himſelf, and that the ſeveral Relatives anſwering ſuch Relation, be each of them an incommunicable Subſtance of an intelligent Nature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That God is differently related to and within himſelf, may without farther Enquiry be gather'd hence, that being poſſeſſed of the plenitude of Perfection, he muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily have Underſtanding; and having Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, in that he is eternal (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 4.) and a pure eſſential Act (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 9.) he muſt actually from all eternity underſtand ſomething; and ſeeing nothing was from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity but himſelf (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 6.) and that therefore he is the Source, Fountain and Comprehenſion of all Being, it evidently follows, that his Underſtanding was from Eternity neceſſarily and primarily, actually carry'd towards himſelf, and by conſequence that God's Underſtanding has an Eternal-ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary-primary-actual Reſpect to himſelf as underſtood. And foraſmuch as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in God but what is his whole entire
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40186:17"/> ſelf (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 11.) 'tis clear, that God's Underſtanding is God, and conſequently that God as knowing himſelf, has an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-neceſſary-primary-actual Reſpect to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as known; and therefore ſince a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as a Knower, is plainly diſtinct from the thing known, as ſuch, and <hi>vice verſa,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe relatively oppos'd to each other, there muſt of neceſſity be different Relations, and anſwerable Relatives thereto, in God; which was the firſt thing to be proved.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The mutual oppoſite Relatives of Knower and Thing known, are therefore evidently in God. And foraſmuch as to know is to have the Likeneſs of the thing known in the Underſtanding of the Knower; to know a thing perfectly, is to have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act likeneſs of the Thing known, without any the leaſt diſſimilitude whatſoever in the Knowers Intellect. Wherefore ſince God is infinite in Perfection (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 7.) he has the expreſs Likeneſs of himſelf, without any the leaſt diſſimilitude whatſoever in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, that is in himſelf (for whatever is in God is God (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 11.) And ſeeing there are no Accidents in God (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 6, &amp; 11.) the expreſs Image or Character which God has of himſelf in himſelf, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial; and conſequently the Relations
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40186:18"/> found in God are ſubſtantial, and not acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Relations; which Relations ſince they are in an intelligent Being, and diſtinct one of them from the other, each of the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives included therein, muſt needs be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable Subſtance of an intelligent Nature, which was the ſecond thing to be proved. Both which together (<hi>viz.</hi> that there are different Relations in God, and that the Relatives anſwering thereto, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and included in them, are each of them an incommunicable Subſtance of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Nature) make it plainly appear, that there are diſtinct Perſons in the Divine Eſſence or God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Farther, in regard Knowledg or the Character of the Thing known, proceeds from the Object or the Thing known, God as knowing himſelf, proceeds from God as known, and ſo is God of God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And foraſmuch as a Son imports an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Being proceeding from an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Being according to Identity of Nature, which among Men is ſaid to be begotten; and that God as a Knower is an intelligent Being, eternally proceeding from God as known an Intelligent Being, according to Identity of Nature, it follows, that God as a Knower, is the eternal Son of God as
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40186:18"/> known; and conſequently, ſince Father is the Correlative of Son, that God as known, is the eternal Father of God as a Knower; whence it is apparent that there are two diſtinct Perſons in the Deity, the Father and the Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection.</hi> The Identity of Nature which is in Father and Son of human off-ſpring, is ſpecifical; but the Identity of Nature in the mentioned Divine Perſons is numerical; and therefore ſince the Appellation of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son is transferred from Man to God; the Notion of them is improperly attributed to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solution.</hi> There is nothing at all, not ſo much as Subſtance or Being, which is univo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally predicated of God and Man. For the Divine Subſtance, whoſe Eſſence is pure Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, and ſtands thereby immediately of it ſelf in a neceſſary contradictory Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Non-Entity, is of a Nature infinitely different and diſtant from the Nature of all created Being (which is the whole Maſs of Being beſides God alone, as will in the next Section be made appear) whoſe Exiſtence, in that it is not eſſential to them, may be or not be, and accordingly before the Creation was not. Yet nevertheleſs when we transfer Names or Notions from Man to God, they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40186:19"/> are not untruly ſpoken of him, becauſe he who ſpeaks them, has no Deſign to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as that he conceived the Name or Notion he makes uſe of, to be a true and perfect Repreſentation of what is really in God; but only that there is that in God, which has ſome Analogy or Reſemblance with that thing whereof he transfers the Name or Notion, from Man to God. And therefore when we call the Firſt Perſon in the Bleſſed Trinity Father, the Second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Son, by reaſon, the Second Perſon, we ſay, proceeds from the Firſt by way of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, we do not intend to ſignifie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that we take the Generation which is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine, and that which is Human to be in all things ſo alike, as the Generation of two Sons by two Fathers in Mankind is alike, it being manifeſt, that the one is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, the other Carnal; the one by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating the ſame Numerical Nature, the other by communicating the ſame Specifical Nature only. And yet in that there is a communicating of Natures (though after a different manner) both by God and Man; from the Reſemblance ariſing thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the interchangeable Notion and Name of Father and Son.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:40186:19"/>8. How the Second Perſon of the Sacred Trinity is God of God, the Son of God, and the expreſs Image or Character of the Father, hath already been ſeen. Why he is likewiſe called the Word of God, and alſo Light of Light, ſhall be now ſhewn. God is Truth it ſelf, by which the Truth of all other things is eſtimated; and therefore, foraſmuch as God the Father is in God the Son, as in a Knower (<hi>par.</hi> 5, &amp; 7.) the Son is the Knowledg of the Father; (for what is Knowledg but the expreſs Image of the Thing known in the Knowers Mind?) And ſo, becauſe Knowledg is an internal Speech, Word or Expreſſion of Truth, the Son of God is thence rightly called the Word of God. And for the like reaſon is he ſaid to be Light of Light; for Knowledg is intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Light; and the Divine Knowledg, which is the Son, being totally and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially derived from the Father (<hi>par.</hi> 6.) is thereupon not improperly ſaid to be Light of Light.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Thus we ſee how the Firſt and Second Perſon, the Father and the Son, are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Notion of <hi>KNOWING.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Knowledg of a Thing, there is in intelligent Beings Delight taken in the thing known, when apprehended to be good,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40186:20"/> which Delight is called a loving of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and the Power or Faculty from whence it proceeds, is named the Will. Wherefore in regard that God is an intelligent Being, and ſo capable of Delight taken in the Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Good, there is that in God which correſponds to the Will in Man, by which he may enjoy good. And ſeeing there is nothing in God which is not eſſential to him; as he eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, neceſſarily, primarily, actually knows; ſo doth he alſo eternally, neceſſarily, primarily, actually will or love; and ſince there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which has an eternal neceſſary Being (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 6.) to be ſo beloved, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God; He eternally, neceſſarily, prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, actually loves himſelf. And becauſe this Love or Reſpect to the Object beloved is a Relation to another for another (for Love and the Thing beloved are relatively diſtinct and mutually oppos'd) there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Relation beſides the two former of knowing and being known, found in God, to wit, Loving or Love; which Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that it has an immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Good, (for Good is the proper Object of Love) Good known to be good, (<hi>ignoti nulla cupido</hi>) is the Correlate to Love. Wherefore in regard that nothing but God himſelf can be the Object of his
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40186:20"/> eternal-neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> primary-actual Love, (he alone being eternal) God known to be good, muſt be the Correlative of that Love. And foraſmuch as Truth is the Good and Perfection of an intelligent Being, God known to be Truth is that very Good. And ſeeing Truth known is the expreſs Character of the Object in the Knowers Intellect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſſimilitude whatſoever from it in it ſelf, God in God is God known to be Truth. Since therefore God to be in God, is the Father to be in the Son (<hi>par.</hi> 5, &amp; 7.) the Relative, which is Love, muſt be related to the Father and the Son directly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their very joint-Relation; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſeeing every Relate denotes Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction from its Correlate; <hi>LOVE,</hi> which is the third Relative, is diſtinct from the <hi>FATHER</hi> and the <hi>SON,</hi> according to their very joint-Relation of Father and Son. Whence it muſt of neceſſity be, that becauſe nothing is in God which is not God (<hi>ſect. 1. par. 11.) LOVE</hi> is God diſtinct from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son, and ſo an intellectual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable Subſtance, and conſequently a Divine Perſon; and thus a Third Perſon is found in God.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And becauſe this Third Perſon is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Father and the Son, as Father
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40186:21"/> and Son (whence they are both but one joint Principle of Love) there are but three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives in the Deity, and conſequently three Perſons only, or a Trinity of Perſons in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Eſſence.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But yet albeit the Third Perſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds both from the Father and the Son, he nevertheleſs proceeds principally from the Father, becauſe Good as Good, is that which produces Love, though it cannot be beloved unleſs known. And therefore though Good known to be Good be the adequate Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Love, yet the whole Force of moving in Good known, is in the Good; and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is but the application of it, that it may move. Whence appears a conſiderable Ground of Reaſon, why our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and ſome of the Primitive Fathers might very well be induced to ſpeak of the Holy Ghoſt's proceſſion from the Father, without mention made of his proceſſion from the Son.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Why the Third Perſon is called the Holy Ghoſt or Holy Spirit, and the Lord and Giver of Life, ſeems to be in reſpect of the Church, which is the peculiar Office of the Holy Spirit (ſent by the Son from the Father) to enliven with Grace, and to breath or inſpire Sanctity into, and not in reſpect of the other two Perſons, in whom
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40186:21"/> Life and Holineſs abound no leſs than in the Third.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Laſtly, Whereas the Divine Eſſence is both <hi>Subjectum</hi> and <hi>Terminus</hi> of the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in God, and that Relatives are <hi>ſimul natura &amp; cognitione,</hi> its plainly conſequent, in regard the Divine Eſſence is an eternal Being (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 4.) and that the Divine Perſons are eternally related to each other, (<hi>par.</hi> 4, &amp; 9. of this <hi>Section</hi>) that the whole <hi>Three Perſons in the Bleſſed Trinity are co-eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal together, and co-equal.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. That God ſhould neceſſarily know himſelf, and be known by himſelf, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neceſſarily love himſelf, appears not to be any ſuch great Myſtery as that of the adorable Trinity has been ever held by the Catholic Church to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> The ſtupendious Myſtery of the Trinity in Unity, appears not ſo plainly in that, as in the Conſequent of it, namely, that God neceſſarily knowing himſelf, and being neceſſarily known by himſelf, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes two diſtinct Perſons, and that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily loving himſelf, conſtitutes a third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon diſtinct from both the other two, whilſt every one of them by reaſon thereof (as hath been ſhewn) is an incommunicable Subſtance, notwithſtanding that there be no
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40186:22"/> more but one only Subſtance in God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Inaſmuch as every one of the Three Perſons is ſaid to be an incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Subſtance, there ſeems rather to be Three entire Subſtances, than only one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> It doth not neceſſarily follow, that becauſe the Father is an incommunicable Subſtance, the Son an incommunicable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and the Holy Ghoſt an incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Subſtance, that therefore there are three ſeveral Subſtances; for the Subſtance of any one of the three Perſons is not a ſeveral Subſtance from the Subſtance of the other Two, whilſt the very ſame numerical Eſſence, Nature or Being is God knowing himſelf, God known of himſelf and God lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf known. And yet becauſe there is nothing at all accidental in God (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 11.) but every thing in him is ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; and that to know, and to be known, and to love what is known, as ſuch, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be the ſame; we muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity hold, that the Divine Nature is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially One, but relatively More; or that the Subſtance of God is diſtinguiſhed, yet not into more Subſtances, but into more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations ſubſiſting in the ſame Subſtance, whence there are three Subſiſtences in one Subſtance, or a <hi>Trinity of Perſons in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Eſſence.</hi>

                  <hi>SECT. III.</hi> The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe was created by God. There was no prae-exiſtent Matter whereof it was made. It is not of the Nature and Eſſence of God. It neither could have been eternal for Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor infinite in Extenſion. There is no Endleſs Number of Worlds. The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is only one, the beſt for Kind that was poſſible to be created.</head>
               <p>1. VVHereas it was proved, <hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 6. that there is only one Firſt-Being, whoſe Exiſtence alone has no dependence on another, it muſt needs be that the Univerſe is either God himſelf, who is that firſt Being, or that it was originally derived from him in every part and parcel thereof.</p>
               <p>2. And that the Univerſe is not God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is plain from this, that God is one ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple uncompounded Being (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 10, 11.) whereas the Univerſe in every part of it is ſome way or other compounded, as for example, Body is compoſed of ſeveral ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Atoms; Man of Body and Soul; and Angels of Eſſence and Exiſtence; and all theſe again of Subſtance and Accident. The
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40186:23"/> Univerſe therefore, with all that therein is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was originally derived from God alone.</p>
               <p>3. And ſince the World is originally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from God alone, every thing which it contains, muſt of neceſſity either participate and be of the ſame Nature and Eſſence which God is of, or elſe they muſt have been crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or produced of nothing, there being only one firſt Being (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 6.) And that they do not participate of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Eſſence with God, is clear from hence, becauſe in that there is nothing in God which is not God (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 11.) they would otherwiſe be God, which for the Reaſon given in the ſecond <hi>Paragraph</hi> of this <hi>Section,</hi> is made appear to be impoſſible. All things therefore without contradiction were at firſt created or produced by God of nothing.</p>
               <p>4. And whatſoever is created and has motion (as all the Parts of the viſible world we are aſſured have,) the ſame could not be eternal, but muſt have had a beginning; otherwiſe there would have been an infinite Duration, an infinite number of Days, of Months, of Years already paſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, ſeeing one Infinite is not greater than another (for it is not Infinite to which any thing can be added) there would have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40186:23"/> been no more Days than Months, nor Months than Years ſince the Creation of the World; and yet on the contrary, ſeeing there are more Days than Months, and more Months than Years in the ſame long continuance of Time, there would have been more Days than Months, and Months than Years ſince the Creation, which is a Contradiction. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſuppoſing the World to have had an infinite duration, and Mankind the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, there was either an infinite Series of Generations of Men a thouſand Years ago paſt, or there was not; if there was not, a thouſand generations elapſed ſince, could not make the foregoing Number infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; for of two Finites added together, an Infinite cannot ariſe. But if the Series of generations of Men was a thouſand years ago infinite, then a thouſand generations have been added ſince to that which was before infinite; and ſo, ſince nothing is infinite to which any addition can be made, the Series of the generations of Men from the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be both infinite and not infinite; which is contradictory and impoſſible.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> It is not properly affirmed of <hi>God,</hi> that he was heretofore, or ſhall be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, but only that he IS; whence we ſee that he himſelf in Anſwer to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> asking him what he ſhould tell the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple his Name was, ſaid, <hi>I AM THAT I AM. Thus ſhalt thou ſay to the Children of Iſrael, I AM hath ſent me unto you,</hi> Exod. 3. 13, 14. For ſince Exiſtence is eſſential to <hi>God,</hi> there is no diviſibility, no praeterition, no futerition, and conſequently no ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor continuance (truly ſpeaking) inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to him. Thoſe things only whoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may be, or may not be, can be rightly ſaid to continue, when their Exiſtence is prolonged by a Cauſe without themſelves, upon whoſe pleaſure their continuance in Being from time to time depends; for that alone can properly be ſaid to continue, which in its Nature is capable to be diſcontinued. But of <hi>God</hi> whoſe Eſſence is Exiſtence, it cannot be properly ſaid, he has been, or ſhall be, but ſolely that <hi>HE IS;</hi> for what is it eſſentially to exiſt, but purely to exiſt? and what is it purely to exiſt, but purely to be? And what is it purely to be, but ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be? And to ſay a thing was or ſhall be, which ſolely is, amounts in effect to this, that it ſolely is, and not ſolely is, a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40186:24"/> thing impoſſible. From <hi>God</hi>'s Exiſtence then a Poſſibility of an eternal Duration or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Succeſſion of Time cannot be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there being no ſuch thing as an eternal Duration incident to the Divine Nature, which is eſſential pure Exiſtence, or <hi>ISNESS,</hi> without was, or ſhall be, in any ſort pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and truly appropriated thereunto.</p>
               <p>5. As the World is not eternal according to Duration, ſo neither is it infinite in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Magnitude, for in caſe it were infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in bulk and greatneſs, the ſpace from the Center of the Earth towards the Eaſt, would be either finite or infinite; if infinite, then the ſpace from the Center of the Earth towards the Weſt, North and South taken together, would not only be no greater than that towards the Eaſt (becauſe one Infinite is not greater than another) but there would alſo be more infinite Spaces in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe than one, neither of which is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; not the former, becauſe three equal Spaces taken together are certainly greater than one alone, which is no greater than any one of them; nor the latter, becauſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Univerſe is not greater than an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Space, it cannot contain more infinite Spaces than one; for otherwiſe it ſhould be greater than it ſelf: But if the Space from
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40186:25"/> the Center of the Earth towards the Eaſt were finite, then alſo the Space from the Center of the Earth towards the Weſt, North and South, would be likewiſe finite, and of four finite Spaces an infinite Space cannot be made; the World therefore is not infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in extenſion.</p>
               <p>6. The World then is neither infinite in reſpect of an eternal duration in which it has continued, nor in reſpect of an immenſe Bulk whereto it is extended. And no leſs certain is it that an infinite number of worlds is equally impoſſible, Number and Infinitude mutually of neceſſity excluding each other, ſince no number that can be augmented is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and that to the greateſt number ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable a new Addition may be made.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing there cannot be an infinite number of Worlds, it follows by neceſſary Conſequence that there is only one. For ſince the Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs are no leſs infinite and eſſential to God than his Omnipotency, or any other Perfection in the Deity is, he cannot without contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Attributes (which it is equally impoſſible for him to do, as to deny himſelf, or to violate his own Nature) will or act any thing which is not according and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the higheſt wiſdom and greateſt good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40186:25"/> or what's the very beſt (all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered) to be effected. Wherefore ſeeing it is impoſſible to create an infinite number of Worlds (<hi>par.</hi> 6.) and that no definite number could be ſo great, but that it would be in the Almighty's power to create a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and greater in <hi>infinitum,</hi> if his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency be ſolely regarded; it plainly follows, that the creating of one World alone was, (all things conſidered) the very beſt; whilſt if it had been better to have created two than one, it would likewiſe have been better to have created three than two, and four than three, and ſo forward without end: in conſequence whereunto, it muſt needs be that one only World was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>8. That there is then but one only world appears evident; which that it certainly is the moſt perfect for kind that could be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, may be gathered from hence, that the wiſdom and goodneſs of God being infinite and eſſential, will not permit him to do any thing but that which (all things duly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is clearly beſt. For if it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he ſhould not always act according to the higheſt wiſdom and greateſt goodneſs, and ſo ceaſe thereupon to be neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely wiſe and good, which he cannot do
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40186:26"/> without ceaſing to be <hi>God.</hi> Nor doth it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow, that, if <hi>God</hi> ſhould act neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, every effect of his acting would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; for no created Being is capable of Infinity, this being peculiar to <hi>God</hi> alone, (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 7.) The Univerſe then is the beſt that it could be made; neither ſeems it to be wholly above the reach of human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conceive in ſome competent meaſure, in what reſpect it could have been no other than what it is. For, <hi>first,</hi> it is clear by the event (not to mention, that it becomes every rational Being to communicate good, when he nothing thereby diminiſheth his own) that it was more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> agreeable to the divine wiſdom and goodneſs to create, than not to create. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is manifeſt that the Almighty could not create any ſingle Creature or Species of Creatures ſo perfect, but that it would be in his omnipotent Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to create others more and more perfect perpetually (foraſmuch as between himſelf and any Creature how perfect ſoever, there would ſtill remain an infinite diſtance) and conſequently that it could never enter into his Mind actually to create any ſingle Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Species of Creatures, for that, if he had done it, he had not acted according to the higheſt wiſdom and greateſt goodneſs,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40186:26"/> becauſe he could ſtill have created better. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It appears conſonant to Reaſon, that it was therefore beſt to create an Univerſe of ſeveral Beings, which in their different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and diſtinct Stations, ſhould conſpire and co-operate together to procure the moſt comprehenſive and excellent End, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever could be created, ſhould in its whole Latitude poſſibly be capable to effect and bring to paſs under <hi>God</hi> the Author and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cauſe of all Good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. If the Almighty cannot but do what is beſt, he is no free Agent, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it was not in his Choice, whether he would have created the World or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> Though the Almighty cannot but do what is beſt, yet he is nevertheleſs a free Agent; for he is not at all neceſſitated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto from any thing without himſelf, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there within himſelf that which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe engages his Will than to make the beſt Choice (or what is moſt agreeable to his eternal immutable wiſdom and goodneſs) which it neceſſarily always doth, but with infinite Freedom; not that there can be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection <hi>in fieri,</hi> or <hi>to be made</hi> (truly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) in <hi>God,</hi> who in that he is a pure eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Act (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 9.) was from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity determined in his Will about all things,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40186:27"/> and his Choice <hi>always made,</hi> and <hi>in facto eſſe; God</hi> at once and ever both actually know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and willing what is infallibly beſt, thro the neceſſary and eſſential perfection of his Nature. So that although <hi>God</hi> could not but create the World, yet was the actual willing thereof moſt voluntary and free, if freedom of Will be a Perfection; for in him dwelleth the fulneſs of Perfection, <hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. If <hi>God</hi> did at once and ever actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally know and will what is infallibly beſt, the World upon that account ſhould have been created from eternity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> There's no neceſſity of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; for although <hi>God</hi> be a pure eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Act (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 9.) and ſo cannot have any new Thoughts ſucceeding one another, but comprehends and wills all things at once together; yet in that he not only ordains the exiſtence of them, but alſo when and how they ſhall exiſt; he might from eternity will the Creation of the World to be ſome thouſands of years only ſince (as we ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly believe from <hi>Sacred Writ</hi> that it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly was.) If it be replied, that, for the ſame reaſon, it was in the Almighty's power to have willed the Creation of the World to have been many thouſand years
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40186:27"/> ſooner than we believe it was; and if ſo, then was he not neceſſitated to create the World when he did; I rejoyn, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <hi>God</hi> always of neceſſity acts according to his abſolute wiſdom and goodneſs (which are invariable and immutable) it follows, that what is at any time <hi>de facto</hi> done by <hi>God,</hi> the ſame is neceſſarily done by him, and for the beſt. For to have the liberty of not acting when, or of otherwiſe acting than right Reaſon dictates a thing to be done, is a weakneſs and imperfection whence Sin ariſes, from which therefore even human Nature, when perfected, is totally freed; and conſequently, ſince <hi>God</hi> is eſſentially perfect, he is eſſentially eſtranged from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 4. If ſo be the Creation was the effect of <hi>God</hi>'s Will, whereunto it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily determined by the Perfection of the Divine Nature, it ſhould ſeem that the Creature is not much obliged to <hi>God</hi> for the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> Since it is impoſſible that <hi>God,</hi> in whom is the Plenitude of all Perfection (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 7.) ſhould create the World for any the leaſt Benefit or Pleaſure to himſelf (more than what he hath and enjoys in his own Will to communicate good) it is manifeſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40186:28"/> that the End for which it was created, was the ſole Good and Benefit of the Creature; which becauſe it could not in any ſort what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever merit from <hi>God,</hi> as having its exiſtence and every other good by the ſole favour of his Bounty; 'tis evident, that the Creature owes it ſelf and all the good it has or ever ſhall enjoy ſolely and wholly to its Maker and Preſerver, as the principal Author and Beſtower of it. Nor ought the Gratitude to be leſs, becauſe the Benefit proceeds from ſuch Kindneſs as the giver could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd from ſhewing by reaſon of his own innate goodneſs, but much the greater; whilſt a Benefit or Kindneſs done, which proceeds from Bounty govern'd by ſolid Reaſon, is more truly and really obliging than that which has no other Bottom, or firmer Foundation than the meer accidental Pleaſure of the Donor: as by the following Inſtance I ſhall endeavour to make out. Two Men being in extream neceſſity, are reliev'd by two of their Neighbors; the one chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gives Relief upon this conſideration, that it is a Good which his Reaſon tells him, he ought by no means to omit the ſpeedy doing of. The other affords help upon no rational ſolid ground which engages him thereto, but is meerly led by his Pleaſure,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40186:28"/> or preſent Inclination to do it. The two Men preſerv'd from periſhing, receive each of them an equal Benefit; but when the one comes to underſtand that the Neighbor who reliev'd him, did it from ſuch ſtedfaſt grounds of Reaſon and Goodneſs within himſelf, that he would for certain not have ſuffered him to periſh. And when the other finds it was almoſt an equal Match, whether he had been loſt or ſav'd, in that his Safety proceeded from a preſent unſtedfaſt Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 'tis obvious that the former would have cauſe to be more intimately and cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thankful, and to love him more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and affectionately that ſaved him alive, than the latter would have reaſon to be unto the other who preſerv'd him from periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. IV</hi> Man was created by God.

He was created in a State of Innocency. What the State of Innocency was. The End for which Man was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In what his Chief Good and Felicity doth conſist.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THat <hi>God</hi> is the Creator of all things, and therefore of Man, was proved <hi>ſect. 3. par.</hi> 2, 3. Who, in that it is evident by certain Experience, that he moves himſelf, whenever he pleaſes, after what particular manner he pleaſes, and to whatſoever Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he pleaſes (without being neceſſarily agitated by Senſe, or Paſſion, or Phantaſie, as Brutes always are) he muſt have ſome Power or Principle within him which is not material; eſpecially ſince he doth ſometimes with great Deliberateneſs and Reaſon, ſet himſelf to oppoſe what the corporeal and animal part ſolicits and prompts him to; and prevails thereby againſt the Allurements of Senſe, the Aſſaults of Paſſion, and the Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40186:29"/> of Phanſie; which could not be, if there were nothing but corporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or the animal Life in Man; becauſe Matter, Senſe, Paſſion and Phanſie make up the whole Animal; and it is not poſſible that the ſame numerical Matter, Senſe, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Phanſie ſhould have at the ſame time quite contrary Motions, Inclinations, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes, croſſing, oppoſing and controlling one another, and therefore it muſt be ſome other Power reſiding in Man, which reſiſts and maſters their Motions, Inclinations and Impulſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is then in Man ſomething beſides corporeal Subſtance, and conſequently ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is not ſubject to Corruption, but is of an indiſſoluble and immortal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For ſince Corruption is the diſſolution of a thing compounded, and diſſolution is ſeparation, and ſeparation diviſion, which cannot be made but in ſomething that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, or may be divided into ſeparate parts, it is apparent, in regard nothing is diviſible into ſeparate parts but what is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, and that Man has a Principle of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in him which is not ſo (<hi>par.</hi> 1.) that there is ſomething belonging to human Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which is incorruptible and immortal, <hi>viz.</hi> the active Power or Principle in Man, which
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40186:30"/> we call the Soul, ſince beſides it and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there is nothing elſe conceivable that conſtitutes the whole Subſtantial Frame of Man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Man's Soul then is of an immortal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And ſeeing we experience within our ſelves, that it has a Faculty to frame Notions of things conceived, to it by the Senſes; and from Notions put together, to make Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and from thoſe Judgments orderly diſpoſed, to infer, or find out ſome Truth whereof it was ignorant before; the Soul is ſaid to be Rational, or endued with Reaſon; for by Reaſon is meant a Power in the Mind of Man which enables him to proceed from the knowledg of one thing to the knowledg of another, by due Conſequences made to that intent and purpoſe. The Soul then has a rational Faculty or Ability whereby it diſcovers the Truth of things, and this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty we uſually call the Intellect or Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And foraſmuch as the End and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit deſigned by Nature to accrue to Man by the knowledg of things, is to diſcern what is convenient or inconvenient, or good or evil for him; and that it would be to ſmall purpoſe nevertheleſs to attain thereunto, if he had not a Faculty or Power enabling him
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40186:30"/> to apply himſelf to that which is good, for the obtaining of it; and to deeline that which is evil, for the avoiding of it; 'tis clear, that, ſince God and Nature make nothing in vain, there is in Man a Faculty by which the Soul is impower'd to deſire good for the acquiring of it; and to have an averſion to evil, for the avoiding of it; which Faculty is called the Will or rational Appetite, becauſe framed by the nature gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it by <hi>God,</hi> to follow the Dictate of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wherefore ſeeing the all-wiſe and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good <hi>God</hi> was the Creator of Man, who conſiſts of Soul and Body, 'tis manifeſt that he had by Creation not only an Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Will, whereby he was capacitated to apprehend and deſire what was truly good for him; but had likewiſe a Body duly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to contribute its aſſiſtance towards the fruition of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And ſince nothing is good to Man as Man, but either that which of all things is moſt convenient for him, or which will do him moſt good (and is therefore called his chief Good) or elſe ſomething that is uſeful and beneficial to him for procuring the ſame; 'tis plain, that Man in the ſtate wherein he was created, underſtood what was his chief
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40186:31"/> Good, and what the proper Means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to procure it were, and made uſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the ſame, ſeeing his Intellect was clear, his Will upright, and his Body in a frame duly ſubſervient to the ſame (<hi>par.</hi> 5.)</p>
               <p n="7">7. Which chief good of Man, in regard he is compoſed of Soul and Body, muſt be ſomething that is beſt, either for the Soul alone, or the Body alone, or for both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. That Man's chief good cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in what is beſt for the Body alone, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from this, that the Soul is undoubtedly the more excellent part of Man; ſo that what is beſt for the Body (be it what it will) muſt of neceſſity be ſome good which is conſiſtent with the good that is beſt for the Soul.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And what is beſt for the Soul, the ſame muſt give the greateſt and higheſt Perfection to it which it is capable of. And the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and higheſt Perfection which the Soul is capable of, muſt needs conſiſt in that which will moſt of all perfect the prime Faculties thereof, which being the Intellect and the Will (<hi>par.</hi> 3, 4.) 'tis manifeſt that that which will moſt perfect thoſe two Faculties, is beſt for the Soul.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And ſince the Intellect is a Faculty of Knowing, and the Will of Deſire; the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40186:31"/> Perfection of the one will be the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt and higheſt Knowledg; and of the other the greateſt and nobleſt good which they are reſpectively capable of.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Wherefore ſeeing the Object of the Intellect or knowing Faculty is Truth; and that the more a Man knows, he is both the more deſirous and more capable ſtill of farther and higher Knowledg; 'tis apparent that the Intellect could not be perfected to its utmoſt Capacity by the Knowledg of all created Beings, if really poſſeſſed thereof, becauſe there would be a more excellent Object than all that, ſtill unknown, to wit, the prime independent Being, which is the Origin and Cauſe of all created Being. The Knowledg therefore of the prime indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Being, ſo far as is attainable by Man, will alone be the utmoſt Perfection of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And foraſmuch as the Will is a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Appetite deſirous of good, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, if it follow the Courſe of Nature imprinted in it firſt by <hi>God (par.</hi> 4.) will certainly deſire above all things that which the Rational Faculty of Knowing, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, directs unto as the greateſt and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt good; it muſt needs be (ſeeing the Intellect, if it judge according to right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40186:32"/> cannot chuſe but determin that the higheſt Knowledg attainable of the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Object, is the greateſt and nobleſt good, which a Being whoſe nature is ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, can poſſibly deſire) that Man's Will ſhall never arrive at its utmoſt Perfection and Satisfaction till the Soul be filled with the higheſt Knowledg attainable of the moſt excellent Object, which is the prime inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Being, or <hi>God (ſect.</hi> 1.)</p>
               <p n="12">12. Wherefore ſeeing it is evident by the two laſt Paragraphs, that the Objective Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection both of the Intellect and the Will is the prime Being under the Notion of Truth and Goodneſs, it plainly follows, that (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was proved in the <hi>Paragraph</hi> above, that whatever is the Perfection of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect and the Will, the ſame is the Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul) <hi>God known and beloved</hi> is the chiefeſt Objective Good of the Soul, called by Divines the <hi>Beatific Viſion,</hi> or <hi>Light of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. And foraſmuch as from the Fruition of the <hi>Chiefeſt Good,</hi> the greateſt and pureſt Joy, Pleaſure and Contentment which Man's Heart is capable of, muſt of neceſſity flow; 'tis clear that the greateſt and pureſt Joy, Pleaſure and Contentment muſt accordingly flow from the <hi>clear Knowledg of God,</hi> or the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40186:32"/> 
                  <hi>Beatific Viſion;</hi> and ſuch Joy, Pleaſure and Content is <hi>formal Perfection,</hi> the <hi>chiefeſt Bliſs</hi> and <hi>ultimate End of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. Hence it is manifeſt, that Man was not made to enjoy, immediatly upon his Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Beatific Viſion; for if he had once enjoyed it, he ſhould have been for ever confirmed and eſtabliſhed in Bliſs. For the Beatific Object once clearly ſeen, will moſt certainly be beloved and delighted in with all the might and power of the Soul, as fully ſatisfying the whole Deſire thereof. And being ſo beloved and delighted in, the Soul cannot otherwiſe chuſe, but with its whole force and ſtrength of affection perpetually deſire the ſight of it, and conſequently there can be no Divorce between the Soul and Object of Felicity, after it is once fully poſſeſſed thereof, by either withdrawing its Affections, or placing them on any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Although therefore Man by Creation (as was proved, <hi>par.</hi> 6.) underſtood what his chief good was, and wherein the Means convenient to procure the ſame were placed, and withal made uſe of the latter to obtain the former by; yet in regard he was not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united to <hi>God</hi> in perfect Love thro' the beſt Knowledg of him, 'tis plain that tho the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40186:33"/> ſtate of Creation was a ſtate of Innocency, Uprightneſs or Integrity, in that Man's Heart was right towards <hi>God,</hi> yet was it not a ſtate of Perfection from which he could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part or fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If Man's own Felicity be the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate End for which he was created, as was ſaid above, <hi>Paragraph</hi> 13. how is it that <hi>God's Glory</hi> is ſo univerſally held, as we know it is, to be the <hi>Final Cauſe</hi> of the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> Man's Felicity, and the glorifying <hi>God</hi> for ever by the Saints in Heaven, are not two ſeveral diſtinct things, but one and the ſelf ſame thing. For ſince Felicity is the greateſt and pureſt Joy, Pleaſure and Contentment flowing from the Beatific Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which Man's Soul is able to contain, (<hi>par.</hi> 13.) and that this very Joy, Pleaſure and contentment doth not at all differ, ſave only in Words, from loving <hi>God</hi> with all the Heart, and with all the Soul, and with all the Mind (for what is it ſo to love <hi>God,</hi> but to take delight in him with the whole power and ſtrength of the Soul?) 'tis plain, that ſuch Love (or perpetual, firm and full ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to <hi>God,</hi> as the moſt deſirable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, with plenary ſatisfaction) being the ſublimeſt &amp; perfecteſt Act which Man's Soul
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40186:33"/> can exhibit to <hi>God,</hi> is to give him the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Honour and Glory, or to own his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Excellency above all other things in the beſt and nobleſt manner which the Soul is able to do. And to this only Act of glorifying <hi>God,</hi> all other Acts of Honour to be given unto him, as inferior to it, do, by Divine Deſignment, directly tend. For to love <hi>God</hi> upon Earth above all things, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a lower degree of the glory which is to be conſummated in Heaven.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40186:34"/> in the contemplation of the Divine Excellence, Attributes and Counſels, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently a more noble Act of honouring <hi>God,</hi> than only to give a full and reverent Aſſent to their Truth, ſince he that does the latter, does the former alſo, and with all the advantage which the operation of the Will moſt vigorouſly re-enforcing and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating the operation of the Intellect by the Souls ſtrongeſt Affections can perform. To which ſupream and comprehenſive Act of glorifying the Divine Majeſty, ſince it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs impoſſible that the Almighty and All-ſufficient ſhould have any regard at all in reſpect of an Advantage either of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or Pleaſure expected to accrue thereby to himſelf (becauſe Perfection being eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Deity, (<hi>ſect. 1. par.</hi> 7.) the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature is even to contradiction inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of acquiring or receiving any manner of Profit or Pleaſure from the beſt Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his Creature) it is manifeſtly plain that God's Deſign in creating Man, was not to receive, but to communicate good.

Wherefore, ſince it is found by daily Experience, that Man is ſo far from loving God alone for his own ſake, and other things in order only to the enjoyment of him, that he loves the things of this World more than he loves God, and prefers the poſſeſſion of them before the fruition of his Maker, 'tis evident, that Man has deſerted the primitive Inſtitution of Nature, and is manifeſtly fallen from the State and Condition wherein he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But becauſe Contraries are made more plainly to be ſeen by their Oppoſites, 'twill be conducible to the better underſtanding of the ſtate where to Man fell, to ſhew more fully than has yet been done, in what his ſtate of integrity principally conſiſted, which was this; <hi>First,</hi> That the Intellect was indued with the true Knowledg of God, ſo that Man by Creation underſtood his Maker to be the Author and End of all things, and the ſole ſovereign Good of the Soul, and withal ſufficiently knew what Duties he was to perform in order to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the ſame. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Will was aright inclined to both, I mean Man's Sovereign Good, and the Duties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to the acquiring of it, and put him

And, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits with the whole frame and compoſure of the Body, were of ſo equal and regular a Temper, that no diſturbance or unruly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceeded from them to excite the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Faculty to any inordinate Deſire. The mentioned Rectitude of the Rational Powers we find within our ſelves to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and the Diſpoſition of the whole man to be changed and altered, whilſt by the Senſes the animal Spirits are vehemently often excited, and the ſenſitive Appetite from thence inflamed to ſeveral Luſts, by which the Will is moved to ſundry inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Deſires, and the Intellect through them is either darkened that it cannot clearly ſee Truth, or elſe is diverted and turned away from the due (Conſideration of it.

               <p n="3">3. Now foraſmuch as the irregular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper which Man has contracted, is not only known to be at preſent Epidemical; but that the Writings of old aſſure us, by the Diſputes had about the Origin of Evil,

The former of which, becauſe the <hi>Divine Oracles</hi> themſelves clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew, we may by conſulting them, be certainly acquainted therewith. And theſe tell us, that God having given in the ſtate of Innocency this Command to Man being placed in Paradice; <hi>Of every Tree of the Garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the Tree of the Knowledg of Good and Evil thou ſhalt not eat of it; for in the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> Gen. 2. 16, 17.

From this Text 'tis obvious to gather that the Tempters Words to <hi>Eve</hi> were but one Motive of three which prevailed with her to eat of the forbidden Fruit; the whole Progreſs of the Temptation ſeeming plainly to have been this. The Words ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Tempter to <hi>Eve,</hi> viz. <hi>God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your Eyes ſhall be opened, and ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing Good and Evil. Gen.</hi> 3. 5. raiſing ſome wavering thoughts in her, whether ſhe ſhould eat of the Fruit or not, induced her to fix her Eyes more earneſtly on it then ſhe had formerly done; whence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more taken with its Beauty than before ſhe had been, (for the Text by ſaying, <hi>when ſhe ſaw it was pleaſant to the Eyes,</hi> gives us to underſtand, that ſhe had not been ſo much delighted with the ſight of it at other times, as ſhe was at that) the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied Sweetneſs of the Taſt, and delicious Nutriment which it would afford, (meant by theſe words, <hi>When ſhe ſaw 'twas good for Food</hi>) and the expected benefit and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of being made wiſe in a moment, wrought all of them together ſo ſtrongly on her Phantaſie, that the Animal Spirits were drawn thereby from their native e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual diſtribution in the Body, to flock in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40186:37"/> greater abundance than uſually to the Seat of the ſenſitive Appetite, which cauſed an immoderate Luſting after the Fruit therein; with which the Will growing, through the Appetites ardency of Deſire, more and more affected, ſtifled at length the Exerciſe of Reaſon, and then fully yielded to the Temptation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Fruit being taſted, pleaſed ſo well <hi>Eves</hi> Palate, and reaching her Stomach, was ſo grateful to it, that ſhe ſtaid not to try what further effect would be wrought by it, but went to <hi>Adam</hi> that he might par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with her of her newly acquired De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Satisfaction; <hi>ſhe gave alſo</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>unto her Husband with her, and he did eat, Gen.</hi> 3. 6. That <hi>Adam</hi> tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Command of God in eating of the forbidden Fruit, as well as <hi>Eve,</hi> is clear then we ſee by <hi>Sacred Writ;</hi> but the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how he was drawn to do it by the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, is not ſo evident in <hi>Scripture,</hi> as how ſhe was overcome by the Serpent; yet thus far however we are aſcertain'd by that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Teſtimony, that it was not done by Arguments which deluded his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſeeing we read that <hi>Adam was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, 1 Tim. 2. 14. but by hearkning unto (or obeying) the Voice of his Wife. Gen.</hi> 3.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40186:37"/> 17. And it will not be difficult to make out the reſt by Reaſon. For if we firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect how Women by their ſmiling Looks, ſweet Words, and amorous Geſtures often overrule their kind Husbands (of which ſort <hi>Adam</hi> was undoubtedly one) and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to do, what otherwiſe they would abſtain from. And if Secondly, we conſider, that the Fruit of the Tree of the Knowledg of Good and Evil being ſweet and delicious, and for that greedily fed upon by <hi>Eve,</hi> would not only quicken and augment her animal Spirits, but would alſo by its too much Nutriment, enflame and overheat her Body, (of an equal Temper, till ſhe had liſtened to the Tempter) and thence excite Venereal Deſires (which are apt to enliven the Luſter of the Eyes, the Briskneſs of the Countenance, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morouſneſs of the Geſture) in her, and ſo render her more delicate and taking than ſhe had formerly appear'd to be, 'twill be the leſs wonder that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, and <hi>hearken to the Voice of his Wife;</hi> eſpecially if withal it be minded that the State of Integrity conſiſted more in the even and unbyaſs'd Frame and Conſtitution of the Body and Soul of Man, than in the ſtrong Habit of Virtue which was by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40186:38"/> through the frequent Exerciſe of pious Duties perform'd to grow to perfection) in the Soul, as is manifeſt by this, that diverſe both Men and Women under the Goſpel Diſpenſation, have through the Power of Chriſtian Virtues, encountred far ſharper Tryals of their Obedience to Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and victoriouſly triumphed over them, than thoſe which our Prime Parents were at the firſt aſſault eaſily vanquiſhed by, as the Multitude of Holy Confeſſors, and glorious Martyrs abundantly teſtifie.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Thus our firſt Parents fell, that is, they eat of the forbidden Tree, by which they were deprived of that Eſtate, which if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in, would have made them at length for ever happy; ſeeing that before their conſenting to eat, their Minds were placed chiefly on God, and ſo only on other Things as ſubſervient and tending to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the full Fruition of him, by loving him with all the Heart, with all the Soul, with all the Strength, and with all the Mind. But as ſoon as their Deſires were ardently ſet on the coveted Fruit, their due Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Mind to God was violated thereby, in that their Affections were turned away from the due Love of God to the inordinate Love of the Apple, by which they depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40186:38"/> from their Original State, in preferring the Vanity of a Senſual Pleaſure before the Spiritual Delight of the Soul.</p>
               <p n="7">7. After the forbidden Fruit was eaten and digeſted, our Prime Progenitors were yet more eſtranged from their Maker by ſtrong Venereal Deſires which it raiſed in them; ſtrong I ſay, becauſe if they had continued in their firſt Eſtate, thoſe Deſires would have been wholly regulated by their Rational Faculties, and not at all violent; whereas after the Digeſtion of the Fruit, they were inflamed with immoderate Luſt to each other, whence looking towards the ſatisfying of their Carnal Appetite, their Spiritual Love to God as their Sovereign Delight ſtood at a ſtill greater diſtance thereby. For that the Fruit, through its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſneſs and nutritive Nature, excited them to Venery (beſides that Phyſitians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, that Sweet being compounded of what is moderately hot and moiſt is very nutritive, and generative Seed the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of Nutriment) may be eaſily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 7. compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 11. whilſt it is ſaid in the ſeventh Verſe, <hi>And the Eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they ſewed Fig-leaves together, and made themſelves A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prons;</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:40186:39"/> and in the eleventh <hi>Verſe</hi> God reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Adam,</hi> who had rendred this Excuſe for hiding himſelf, that he was afraid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was naked, ſaid, <hi>Who told thee that thou waſt naked? haſt thou eaten of the Tree whereof I commanded thee, that thou ſhouldeſt not eat?</hi> fairly intimating that the eating of the Tree was that which diſcovered to our firſt Parents their Nakedneſs, not ſo much by putting them in mind of their Sin, as by manifeſting of their Shame, the latter of which it was that troubled them, not the former, as ſeems evident by their covering of their Nakedneſs, and excuſing their eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Fruit. So that this which was their Fault gave them not their Diſturbance, but 'twas the Effect thereof that cauſed their Trouble, to wit, their Nakedneſs, or the ſwelling Motion of their Generative Parts, not then under the abſolute Power and Command of their Wills, as they had formerly, no leſs then the reſt of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Body, always been; which thing being aſhamed of, they ſought to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe unruly Parts by ſewing Fig-leaves together, and making themſelves Aprons to hide them with. Nor is this a new Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Paſſage, as the great St. <hi>Austin</hi> will witneſs, whoſe Words are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40186:39"/> theſe; <hi>Poſteaquam Praecepti facta est tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſio confestim gratià deſerente Divinâ, de corporum ſuorum nuditate confuſi ſunt, unde etiam foliis ficulneis, quae forte a perturbatis prima comperta ſunt, pudenda texerunt, quae prius eadem Membra erant, ſed pudenda non erant ſenſerunt ergo novum motum inobedientis Carnis ſitae. tanquam reciprocam poenam inobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiae ſuae.

               <p n="2">2. Wherefore ſince we are convinced by conſtant Experience that Mans Body, by reaſon of its cloſe Conjunction and Union with the Soul, has ſuch an Influence on it, that it certainly inclines it to all manner of Affections which the animal Parts excites it to, except when Reaſon prevails with the Will to reſiſt the Motions of the ſenſitive Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, (which cannot be while the Intellect is uncapable of the Exerciſe of Reaſon) 'tis manifeſt that, ſeeing Children in the Mothers Womb have not at all the uſe of Reaſon, there will be in their Souls an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination or Habitude agreeable and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent to the Diſpoſition of their corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Part, which, in that it is begot and conceived of Seed iſſuing from diſordered Bodies, will it ſelf be in diſorder, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by cauſe an unanſwerable diſorderly Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the ſenſitive Faculty, inclining it to Objects of ſenſe, and that again work a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40186:41"/> proportionable inordinate Habitude in the Will, which bereaving it of the due Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation it ought to have towards the true Object of Felicity, cauſes a Want of that Original Diſpoſition of Soul, which ſhould and would have been in Children, if ſo be Man had continued in the State of Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which Want is that Malady of the Soul Men call Original Sin, or Privation of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Righteouſneſs, and is the Conſequent, in the manner above explain'd, of eating the forbidden Fruit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By this Explication of Original Sin, God is juſtified, and cleared from all Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of being cauſe thereof; whereas, if the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> was tranſferred to his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, becauſe their Wills are included (as ſome ſay) in his, I ſee not how the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could be cleared from being the Author of it. For ſince the Wills of Children are not really and truly by Nature in the Wills of their Parents (for otherwiſe all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould of Right be guilty of all the Sins of their Parents) the Wills of <hi>Adams</hi> Progeny could not be included in the Will of <hi>Adam,</hi> unleſs God, in whoſe Power the Wills of all Men are, would for his Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſake have it ſo.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40186:41"/> 
                  <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity be included in <hi>Adams</hi> Will, it follows, that by the ſame Conſtitution the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> is his Poſterities Sin alſo, in that the very Reaſon why the Sin of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> becomes the Sin of his Poſterity, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Wills are voluntarily conſtituted by God in his Will, which, if it were true, would make God the Author of Original Sin.</p>

If Original Sin be derived from <hi>Adam</hi> by Propagation, it cannot be a Privation of Original Righteouſneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Privation is the meer want of a thing, and not a Poſitive thing which may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> There are two things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in Original Sin, an Habitude or Proneneſs in the Will towards the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Creature, and a Want of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Righteouſneſs, or Diſpoſition of the Soul towards God, which it had by Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now although the Want of Original Righteouſneſs be truly and properly Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin, (becauſe if there were no want of that, there would be no Original Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs) yet in that the native Habitude or Proneneſs of the Will towards the Creature (<hi>Par.</hi> 2.) inſtead of God, is the reaſon why the Soul becomes deprived of Original
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40186:42"/> Righteouſneſs, that Habitude or Proneneſs of the Will is alſo called Original Sin (which that, and how, it proceeds by means of natural Generation was ſhown in <hi>Par.</hi> 1. 2.) And it is ſo in all manner of Vice, that the irregular Act or Habit is not Vice formally taken; but the Privation of the oppoſite Virtue, which enſues upon that irregular Act or Habit, and yet nevertheleſs the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Act and Habit are both called Vice Metonimically, becauſe it is a neceſſary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of each. For inſtance, an intemperate Act or Habit is ſaid to be a Vice, and yet the formal Reaſon of their Vitiouſneſs confiſts in this, that the one (at leaſt) weakens, the other deſtroys the Virtue of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, (or in caſe a Man be intemperate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they render it more difficult for him to become Temperate, by ſtrengthening or encreaſing his Intemperance) for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any thing ſhould be morally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but as it deprives of ſome moral Good, or weakens it, or puts a Man farther from it; for if by Intemperance a Man were not a whit the leſs Virtuous, he would not be one jot the more Vitious, than if he were not Intemperate at all. And the like may be as truly ſaid of any other irregular Act or Habit of the Will. If it be urged, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40186:42"/> in caſe Original Sin deſcend in the manner before deſcribed; by propagation, it would rather be derived to us from our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Parents, than from our Firſt, ſince another Temper of Body is communicated by them to us, then what was derived from <hi>Adam</hi> to his own Children, (as is evident from the manifold different natural Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions we meet with in young Children) and yet Original Sin is ſolely fixed to the eating of the forbidden Fruit; my Anſwer is, that though it be very true that Infants receive another Diſpoſition from their more immediate Progenitor, than what has been perpetually derived from <hi>Adam,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that ſome of them alſo have a greater propenſity to Vice through the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Faults of their nearer Anceſtors and Parents; yet in that the whole Stock of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ever ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> has had a proneneſs from their Conception, to the Creature, in room of the Creator, by reaſon of the firſt Tranſgreſſion; Original Sin is rightly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the eating of the forbidden Fruit, it being certain that from that Fault alone (though there had never been any other) therewould have enſued a Want of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Righteouſneſs in all Mankind.

                  <hi>Solut.</hi> Although Concupiſcence be never totally rooted out of the ſenſitive Faculty in this Life, yet it doth not always (as it does Infants who have not the uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) neceſſarily ſo influence the Will, as it does the ſenſitive Appetites (and the Will is the only proper Seat of Sin) but may through a virtuous Courſe of Life, be ſo far maſtered and ſubjugated to the Power and Command of the Will, that it ſhall be able to give but ſmall and ineffectual di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance to the Rational Faculties; which actually falls out, ſo often as the Soul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the Habit of Virtue, whereby it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a ſincere Affection to God as its Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Good; for ſuch Affection or Charity (as ſhall be ſhown afterward, <hi>Sect.</hi> 11.) not only frees the Soul from Original, but all other mortal Sin likewiſe; whilſt it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by formally juſtified and put into a State of Grace and Salvation.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:40186:43"/>4. The mentioned Difficulties about O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Sin removed, I go forward to ſhew, that as Original Sin proceeds from our firſt Parents eating of the Tree of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Good and Evil; ſo doth Actual Sin from Original, as the Source and Spring from whence it flows. For Original Sin being a Want of Original Righteouſneſs by reaſon of an Habitude or Proneneſs to the Love of the Creature, in the Soul; that Habitude or Proneneſs, when the Intellect is once capable of actually apprehending an Object of ſenſual Delight, will be apt to proceed to an actual Deſire, which is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sin; unleſs ſome rational Motive be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Underſtanding, which ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the Will to prefer the Spiritual Joy of the Mind before the ſenſual Pleaſure of the Body; which, for cauſe that ſhall be ſhewn <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. cannot generally (if at all) be, but by virtue of ſupernatural Helps from God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And not only Sin both Actual and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, but all ſorts of Miſeries likewiſe which befall Mankind, proceed from eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the forbidden Fruit. For as for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, Diſeaſes, Sickneſs, and Death, they, at firſt ſight almoſt, ſhew whoſe ugly Brats they be. For what is Death but a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40186:44"/> ſeparation of Soul and Body? and whence comes this, but from ſome either exceſs or defect of Humors in the Body? and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe had been found in the World, if the ſame Conſtitution of Body had ſtill continued in all Mankind, which was in our firſt Parents, till they were induced to eat of the forbidden Fruit. For ſince in theſe words, <hi>Duſt thou art, and to Duſt ſhalt thou return, Gen.</hi> 3. 19: is contained part of <hi>Adams</hi> Doom, it appears, that if he had not ſinned, he had not died; that is, if he had not eaten of the Tree of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Good and Evil, he had not been deprived of that Conſtitution of Body, which would always have preſerved him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. And for Diſeaſes and Sickneſs, what elſe are they, but Male-diſpoſitions of the Body, ariſing from an undue Mixture of Humors, or from ſome Obſtruction (both which the State of Innocency was clear and free from) tending to Death? So that a Diſeaſe or Sickneſs as ſuch, may be rightly ſaid to be Death or a Diſſolution begun; which verifies in a literal ſenſe (over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the myſtical) the words ſpoken by God to <hi>Adam, On the day thou eatest thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die;</hi> for the juſt Temper of his Body was then corrupted when the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40186:44"/> Temptation prevailed, the firſt cauſe of all the ſucceeding Alterations, which brought it by degrees to diſſolution. And as to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, whereunto add corporal Exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances and Defects, do they not all come from an unequal Quantity and Diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Seed, or elementary Principles which befel Mans Body at firſt from eating of the Apple or Fruit? Grief then, together with Diſcord, Damnation and Hell, remain on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſpoken of, which when I have firſt anſwered an Objection that here offers it ſelf, I ſhall make known whoſe foul and curſed Off-ſpring they likewiſe be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. 'Twas ſaid <hi>Sect. 4. Par.</hi> 12. that Man was created to enjoy the Beatific Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which how he could have done, if ſo be our firſt Parents had continued innocent, and never have died, is not eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> It is eaſier to conceive that, then how, if Mankind had been immortal, the Earth ſhould have born them; for the Multitude of Men by a perpetual Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would have exceeded the number of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms in the Univerſe. But in caſe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect how that the State of Innocency was not a State of Perfection, (<hi>Sect. 4. Par.</hi> 15.) and yet that Man was created to attain
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40186:45"/> Perfection in the full Fruition of God by Intellectual Viſion, (<hi>Sect. 4. Par.</hi> 12.) 'tis not difficult to gather, that <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity, if they had perſevered in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, ſhould have been exerciſed for a time in ſuch Duties, Ways and Means, as would have only prepared them for the Everlaſting Enjoyment of God, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is placed in the perfect Love of God clearly ſeen, (<hi>Sect. 4. Par.</hi> 13.) thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Ways and Means muſt have been ſuch, as would from time to time have excited and encreaſed their Affection to God, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerving, admiring, and lauding his excellent, and wonderful Power, Wiſdom, and Godneſs manifeſted in the admirable Works of the Creation, and the continual Preſervation of them; which when they had ſo long and effectually done, that they could have been no longer ſatisfied with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Creator in the Glaſs of the Creature, their Deſire of ſeeing him in Himſelf would have grown ſo vehement, that they could have had no Reſt without ſeeing him face to face; and conſequently, ſince the Almighty had made them for that End, and appointed thoſe Means they had uſed to fit them for it, 'twould have been altogether becoming, and conſentaneous to,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40186:45"/> his unchangeable Goodneſs to tranſlate them from the Earthly to the Heavenly Paradiſe, their Natural Bodies being changed into Spiritual Bodies, (and thereby made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet to live on the Terreſtial Globe) like as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of thoſe that ſhall be found alive at the day of Judgment, <hi>Behold I ſhew you a Myſtery, we ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed. 1 Corinth. 15. 51. And again, Then we which are alive ſhall be caught up together with them (i. e.</hi> the Dead in Chriſt, <hi>Verſ. 16.) in the Clouds to meet the Lord in the Air, and ſo ſhall be ever with the Lord. 1 Theſſ.</hi> 4. 17. Why all this ſhould not be rationally enough offer'd in anſwer to the Objection, I apprehend not. But yet if we ſeriouſly reflect that God is Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient, and knows at once and always e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, and by conſequence had as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily in his Knowledg the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> as his Creation, we muſt conclude that God from Eternity determined how <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould be dealt with after his Fall, rather than what his Progreſs to Bliſs ſhould be in caſe he fell not, when as he inerrably knew he would certainly fall. And therefore he had no earlier Thoughts of creating Man, than he had of calling him to Repentance, and of providing him a Saviour, (the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40186:46"/> whereof will be ſhown in the <hi>9th. Section</hi>) there being no ſucceſſion of Thoughts in God concerning thoſe things whereof there is a Succeſſion in themſelves; whence he at once eternally ſaw the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and End of it, with all the Means, whereby it was to be ſucceſſively brought to paſs, of which we have ſome imperfect Reſemblance in a skillful Architect, who about to build a ſtately Palace, has the whole Model of the Building together in his Mind, although the Parts thereof be ſucceſſively framed, and the Materials fitted for the Work one after another. For the Omniſcient ſaw together in his Thoughts the nobleſt Univerſe of Creatures, which all Created Beings could poſſibly conſtitute for producing the moſt Excellent End that could be. (<hi>Sect. 3. Pag.</hi> 8.) Among thoſe Creatures ſome were to operate neceſſarily, ſome voluntarily, towards procuring the general grand Effect to be produced; of the latter ſort of which, Man was ordained to bear a conſiderable ſhare; who, though by original Conſtitution he might have kept his Native Integrity, yet our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Incarnation, Doings, and Sufferings occaſioned by the Laps, were as primarily intended by God, as the very Creation it
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40186:46"/> ſelf. For the All-wiſe and All-good God infallibly knowing what Uſe Man would make of the Freedom of his Will, deſigned his Creation no ſooner than he did a Way, which ſhould not only prevent the defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the End for which he made man; but would alſo be a means to advance it to an higher degree of Perfection than it could have had without it; whilſt man has by the Bleſſed Incarnation of the Son of God, (of which hereafter in the <hi>9th. Section</hi>) and the gracious Sequel of it, far greater Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to the Love of God (in which Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity conſiſts, <hi>ſect. 4. par.</hi> 13.) than by the Creation, and all other things beſides whatſoever; and conſequently a certain Means of augmenting the intenſneſs of his Affection to God, and thereby the greatneſs of his eternal Bliſs, as will hereafter be made out, <hi>ſect.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This occaſional interruption over, I go on to ſhew, that Grief, Fear, Diſcord, Damnation and the Torments of Hell are ſo many ſeveral Branches of the Tree of the knowledg of good and evil. For as for Grief, it is a Paſſion which ariſes from the Senſe of an incumbent Evil, and Fear from the apprehenſion of an evil approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo that, in regard there could have no
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40186:47"/> evil happened if Man had continued inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, there would have been neither Fear nor Grief in the World. Nor ſhould Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord or Wars have been found amongſt men, if their Appetites had continued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and ſubject to Reaſon; for generally it is becauſe that ſeveral men deſire the ſame ſingle thing (which one alone can but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy at the ſame time) that differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, which, if the Parties concerned be Sovereigns, often grow to Wars. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other cauſe of Diſſentions there be, 'tis the effect of immoderate Deſires which ſprouted from the Tree of the knowledg of good and evil. There is then no Miſery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to Man, if Damnation and the Pains of Hell be within the Liſt, but derives its Origin from thence; which that they are, ſhall be the Work of the following Section to make appear.</p>
            </div>

               <head>
                  <hi>SECT. VII.</hi> Eternal Damnation, or the perpetual Loſs of Bliſs, inevitably follows from the perpetual Alienation of the Souls Affections from God. Eternal Torments, or the Pains of the Damned neceſſarily for ever accompany their impious Deſires of preferring worldly Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties before the Enjoyment of God. Hence by theſe two, an Averſion from the Creator, and a Converſion to the Creature, Man makes himſelf eternally miſerable.</head>
               <p n="1">1. SInce it has been proved (<hi>Sect. 4. par.</hi> 13.) that eternal Felicity conſiſts in the immenſe Pleaſure, Joy and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that flows from the Beatific Viſion, or Intellectual Sight of God, and that the ſame Pleaſure, Joy and Contentment is the Love of Complacency, or Delight whereby the Soul inſeparably adheres to God with all its might (<hi>ſect. 4. par.</hi> 14.) 'tis plain that ſuch Alienation of the Soul's Affections from God, as ſhall for ever deprive it of ſuch adherence to him, muſt of neceſſity deprive it of everlaſting Bliſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And in regard an everlaſting depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Bliſs is that eternal Miſery, which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40186:48"/> the Schools call <hi>Poena Damni,</hi> 'tis clear that Damnation, or the perpetual Loſs of Bliſs inevitably follows the perpetual Alienation of the Souls Affection from God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And whereas it is impoſſible to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Souls Affections from God upon his own account, becauſe in him is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil, 'tis manifeſt that for the gratifying of ſome inordinate Deſire, as the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, or Pride of Life, man's Soul is alienated in affection from God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore if the Souls Affections be in this Life ſo bent upon Riches, Honour, Luxury, Revenge, or other worldly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, that it prefers any of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the enjoyment of God; and thence makes choice thereof as its chief Good and Felicity, or the thing wherein it is above all others delighted, it muſt needs be, that whatſoever Soul departs this Life ſo affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, muſt either forſake and leave off that its deſire, or be ſatisfied with the Fruition of the Thing deſired, or elſe be eternally tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for to be for ever deprived of that which the Soul perpetually longs for, will be an endleſs affliction.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And <hi>firſt,</hi> That a Soul departing this Life with an habitual affection to ſome
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40186:48"/> worldly Vanity wherein it delights, cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhake off that its Deſire, is apparent from this, that the Will (which is an eſſential Faculty of the Soul) can never be void of ſome Deſire or other, and that it is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable how it ſhould part with thoſe it is habitually poſſeſſed of when it leaves the Body, ſince it is certain that the love of God in pious Souls, begun here on Earth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues after Death, and accompanies them to Heaven (as will be ſeen <hi>ſect. 13. par.</hi> 2.) and that the Nature of Qualities or habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Diſpoſitions, whether good or bad, as to their inherence in the Soul, is in all men alike. And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> That thoſe Luſts which inſeparably adhere to mens Souls af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, can never with the enjoyment of what they deſire, be ſatisfied, is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true, as that their Return to the Earth to enjoy the Pleaſures of this World, ſhall never come to paſs. And <hi>thirdly,</hi> that men who have inordinate deſires, ſhall after death endure Torments anſwerable to the ſtrength of Affection which they have for the Things they luſt after, and cannot poſſibly enjoy, may be gathered from the afflicted miſerable condition of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon Earth whoſe Hearts are irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſet on Riches, Honour, Luxury, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40186:49"/> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when they find themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally diſappointed of what they earneſtly deſire. For does not Experience ſhew us, that the Heart of many a covetous Wretch is ſo cemented to his Gold, that when it is ſtollen from him, his Life, which before he would not have exchanged for Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes his Hell, ſo as that he haſtens by the firſt thing in his way to be delivered from it? And are not the Thoughts of ſome vain-glorious and ambitious men ſo intent upon Honour, that falling into Diſgrace, their very Hearts burſt for grief of the want of that alone, amidſt the affluence of almoſt all other worldly Goods beſides? As ſad diſtreſs befals not a few forlorn Lovers, whoſe Affections are ſo faſt glewed to their Miſtreſſes, that they judge no Pain like that of fruſtrated Love, inſomuch that they chuſe the readieſt for the beſt way of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering violence to their reſtleſs weariſom Lives. What ſhall I ſay of envious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful wiſhes not accompliſhed, than which no Viper can more cruelly gnaw mens Hearts? If then mens Deſires may be ſo violent, and the fruſtrating of them ſo grievous, as hath been ſaid, while the Soul is involved in a Body of Clay, how fierce will the one, and how intolerable
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40186:49"/> will the other be, when its Operations are not damped thereby?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. 'Tis a Maxim, That men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deſire what they know is impoſſible to be had; which if true, the damned cannot retain any affection for the things of this world, becauſe they are certain they muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return to earth to get poſſeſſion of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> That Maxim is true only of as many as are governed by right Reaſon, but not of ſuch as are overborn by Paſſion or Wilfulneſs. For wherefore ſhould the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious man's heart burſt through grief for the loſs of Honour, if he either hoped to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to it again, or that his Affections were taken off it, ſince none kill themſelves with Sorrow, while there is hope of having what they wiſh; nor grieve for want of that which they have no deſire to? When the Miſer has loſt his Gold, if he either ſaw an appearance of getting it again, or found a willingneſs in his Mind to forget it, he would not be ſo haſty, as for diſpatch ſake, to be his own Executioner. Nor is the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Cup acceptable to the diſtreſſed Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, becauſe his Miſtreſs is not at hand, but becauſe his hopes of enjoying her is at an end, and yet his deſire of mutual Embraces is no whit leſſened, but more enlarged
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40186:50"/> thereby. And if the Maxim hold not good in thoſe and other vicious men while in the Fleſh, neither will it when they are depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hence, ſeeing their Affections are ſo far from leaving them, that they are encreaſed and become more vehement by the Souls being ſeparated from its Body of lumpiſh Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. There be ſeveral Places in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture where Hell is ſet forth by ſuch a Fire as ſeems plainly to denote an external material Fire; as the <hi>Furnace of Fire,</hi> Mat. 13. 42. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nquenchable Fire,</hi> Mark 9. 43. <hi>The Lake of Fire,</hi> Revel. 20. 15. The Flames of Hell therefore are not an internal, but an external Fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> Since the Reaſons given above, ſhew that the Demned are moſt grievouſly tormented with the internal and unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Flames of their own ardent and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually fruſtrated Deſires, the Furnace of Fire, and the Lake of Fire ſpoken of in Scripture, muſt either be another Hell of tormentive Flames, or elſe but Expreſſions fitted to the Capacities of the generality of the People, (who are to be taught in Words adapted to their Underſtandings) to ſignifie unto them the extremity of the Pain and Miſery which vicious men for ever
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40186:50"/> ſuffer after Death. But that there are more Hell-Fires than of one kind mentioned in Scripture, is no where, I think, to be met with in it. And in regard the Torments of Hell are deſcribed likewiſe, by the <hi>Worm that dieth not,</hi> Mark 9. 44. by <hi>weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth;</hi> as alſo by <hi>outer Darkneſs,</hi> Mat. 22. 13. as well as in the other Places, by <hi>Fire;</hi> and that theſe Expreſſions are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>Tropical</hi> (ſince a Worm cannot gnaw upon the Souls of the Damned, which yet are held to endure the Pains of Hell before their re-union to the Body; that Spiritual Subſtances cannot really ſhed Tears, nor gnaſh Teeth; and that there is no Darkneſs amidſt abundance of material Fire) it will be, I preſume, an hard matter to produce a convincing Argument, why the Furnace of Fire, and the Lake of Fire muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be literally underſtood; eſpecially ſeeing the Damned endure intolerable Pain, though there be no external Puniſhment at all in any ſort whatſoever inflicted on them. Add hereunto, that whereas in <hi>Matth,</hi> 5. 22. it is written, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſay unto his Brother thou Fool, ſhall be in danger of Hell-Fire;</hi> Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> has it in the Margin, <hi>liable to the Fire in the Valley of</hi> Hinnom, which Fire being long ſince extinct, cannot in a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40186:51"/> Literal Senſe ſignifie the tormentive Flames of Hell. Beſides, why the Pleaſures and Joys of Heaven ſhould be myſtically repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the <hi>21st.</hi> and <hi>22d. Chapters</hi> of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of St. <hi>John;</hi> and yet the Pains and Torments of Hell ſet forth by Fire in the <hi>20th. Chapter,</hi> ſhould admit of none but a Literal Interpretation, is a thing unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable. If Reply were made, that the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> is wholly <hi>Myſterious,</hi> whereas other Scriptures are ſo only here and there; I would retort, That then the Lake of Fire, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 15. is not to be underſtood according to the Letter, no more than the pleaſant Objects of Delight (<hi>Rev.</hi> 21, and 22. quoted before) of the <hi>New Jeruſalem;</hi> which if ſo, by Hell-Fire in other Places of Sacred Writ is not meant a material Fire, except the Lake of Fire in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the Furnace of Fire in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and unquenchable Fire in St. <hi>Mark,</hi> relate not all to one and the ſame manner of Torment; which if any one will ſay they do not, let him bring a convincing Reaſon for ſo doing, and be believed. Laſtly, Whereas if Hell-Fire be a Torment externally forced on the wicked, ſeveral Difficulties (to my apprehenſion, inſuperable) offer themſelves; as, <hi>Firſt,</hi> How a material Subſtance can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40186:51"/> act on an immaterial which is not eſſentially united with it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Why a finite Act, or a Thing done and paſt ſhould be puniſhed with endleſs Pain. And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Wherefore the Creator ſhould eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally afflict his Creature for no good at all to himſelf, for doing of that which can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther really harm, nor grieve him; eſpecially ſince that which men call Vindicative Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, cannot in Reaſon be exerciſed either by God or Man, as ſhall hereafter be made appear in the <hi>10th. Section.</hi> But in this other way of mens fruſtrated vicious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires tormenting themſelves, there's no need of thoſe or any ſuch like ſtrange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Suppoſitions, while the damned are their own Tormentors, and yet volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily perſiſt in thoſe deſires wherewith they are tormented; becauſe in the Object of them is their conceived Felicity placed. For the Covetous, Ambitious, Voluptuous, or Revengeful Mind could not at all reliſh the ſpiritual Joys of Heaven, nor would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change what it more values, for the full Fruition and perpetual poſſeſſion of them; according to that which we find elegantly ſaid by the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Cauſes of the Decay of Chriſtian Piety;</hi> 
                  <q rend="margSglQuotes">
                     <hi>Alas what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light would it be to the Swine to be wrapped in

                  </q> But what ſtill more confirms the Truth of that which has been writ in this Section; according to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin aſſerted in it, Heaven and Hell are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ſet againſt each other; and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways that lead unto them diametrically oppoſite to one another. For the Joys of Heaven are the fulfilling the Souls deſires in the fruition of the really chief Good of man. The Torments of Hell, the Fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Souls deſires of ſome falſly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Chief Good. Virtue, the Way of Bliſs, is the preferring the Love of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Love of the World. Vice, the Path of Hell, is the preferring the Love of the World before the Love of God. And as the Beatified Souls according to the higher degree of Love wherewith they are affected to God, are more happy becauſe fuller of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light ſo the damned Spirits, the ſtronger affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they have to the things they luſt after, are more grievouſly tormented, the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of a ſtronger affection being more afflictive than of a weaker.</p>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40186:53"/> Deſires, there would be no Puniſhment, but only the loſs of Heaven, allotted to that moſt horrid Crime.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> Murther is a crying Sin indeed; for it ſtays not for the Judgment of the World to come, but it ſelf begins its own Puniſhment here, the Mutherer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tortured and diſtracted almoſt with the repreſentation of the Act alone, whilſt it is a thing ſo deteſtable, and repugnant to the very Being of human Nature, that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of all his endeavours to the contrary, he ſtarts, and is agaſt at the horror of it, as often as it occurs to his mind (though but in ſleep, when he neither dreads the Sentence of a terreſtrial nor celeſtial Judg.) So that when after this Life, he ſhall have no intervention of neceſſary buſineſs to divert his Thoughts from it, 'twill be terrible and tormentive to him beyond expreſſion, ſince his very Eſſence will have a perpetual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect antipathy to it, and yet he ſhall ever be haunted and infeſted with its ghaſtly and dreadful viſage. But beſides, murtherers are tormented as well as other Sinners by their fruſtrated deſires; for Good being the Object of the Will, every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is endued therewith, has an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for ſome or other either real or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40186:53"/> Good, and 'tis this latter that the wicked of all ſorts ardently affect; though they judg in general the ſtate of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saints to be true felicity, and their own condition a ſtate of miſery (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they can by no means reliſh the manner of delight which the Bleſſed have) for otherwiſe there could be no ſuch Pain as <hi>Poena Damni,</hi> the loſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſince none are troubled for the want of that which they have not any reſpect or eſteem at all for; whence the very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency of the Thoughts of the damned concerning true and falſe Bliſs, ſet their minds upon the Rack. To which is to be added yet another Torment which afflicts likewiſe, without exception, the whole Crew of reprobate Souls, to wit, the gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Viper of Envy and Malice towards the Saints in Bliſs, in that they obtain their full deſires, when they themſelves are totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their own.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. VIII.</hi> The only Evil which is prejudicial to Man in reſpect of the End for which he was created, is <hi>Malum Culpae,</hi> the Evil of Fault; and it is either Privative or Poſitive, The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer conſists in an Averſion from God; the latter in a Converſion to the Creature. Each of them is called Sin, the one Formal, the other Material. The greateſt Alienation of the Heart from God makes the greateſt Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</head>
               <p n="1">1. SEeing it was proved (<hi>ſect.</hi> 4.) that God created <hi>Man,</hi> not for any Good whatſoever to accrue thereby to himſelf, but ſolely and wholly to communicate Good to his Creature, 'tis manifeſt that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can harm or prejudice <hi>Man</hi> in reſpect of the End for which he was created, but that alone which is prejudicial to him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his own final Good; which ſince it has been ſhewn (<hi>ſect. 4. par.</hi> 13, 14.) to conſiſt in the perfect Love of God, 'tis clear that nothing is evil to man as man, or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to inherit Bliſs, but either the very Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enation it ſelf of the Hearts Affection from
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40186:54"/> God; or ſomething which cauſes the ſame; or is an inducement thereunto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And ſince the alienation of the Hearts affection from God, is in reſpect of God an averſion from him; and that it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent there can be no averſion from God, (in whom there is not any the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of evil) but through the inordinate deſire of ſome temporal Benefit, or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which is preferred before him; 'tis manifeſt that in theſe two, <hi>Averſio à Deo, &amp; Converſio ad Creaturam,</hi> an averſion from God, and a converſion to the Creature, is contained the whole Evil that befall man as man, or a rational Creature made to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy everlaſting Bliſs, ſince nothing elſe can make him fail of being eternally happy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And foraſmuch as the Evil which is an Averſion from God, is a meer Privation of that Love of God which the Soul ought to have towards him, 'tis plain that actual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil (called by Divines <hi>Malum Culpae actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> or <hi>Peccatum actuale</hi>) cannot be placed in an Averſion from God, but in a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Creature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet in regard it would be no hindrance to man's Felicity however ſtrongly his Soul were addicted to any temporal Good, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Soul's Affection to God were not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40186:55"/> any thing abated thereby, 'tis clear that Sin formally taken is that Evil which is an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion from God, and that the Converſion of the Heart to the Creature, or the inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Love of the World and worldly Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, is Sin materially only (and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally) conſidered.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But this notwithſtanding, ſince it is not poſſible, but that the Soul which immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately affects the Creature, or the ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an inordinate Deſire, muſt of neceſſity have its due Affection to God hindred or abated thereby, 'tis evident that in every inordinate, immoderate Converſion to the Creature, there is always neceſſarily impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and involved an averſion from God, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to love two Things, God and the World chiefly, that is, God above the World, and the World above God both at the ſame time, is plainly repugnant and impoſſible) in regard of which it is properly ſinful, or formally a Tranſgreſſion of the Law of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence it comes to paſs that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Act conceived to be prohibited by the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> is no real Breach thereof, ſave only when, and as it impedes or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth the Souls due Affection or Love, which of right it ought to have to God, in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40186:55"/> order to its own Felicity, as ſhall hereafter in the explication of the <hi>ſeventh</hi> and <hi>Eighth Commandments (Sect.</hi> 19.) be made appear.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the greateſt Alienation therefore of the Heart from God, is the greateſt ſin; which Alienation becauſe it befalls the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in that their Averſion from God is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, the Damned are the greateſt Sinners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. 1. Sin is the Tranſgreſſion of the Law of God. 1 John</hi> 3. 4. and the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law is therefore ſinful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is repugnant to the Divine Will, and an Offence to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> The Definition of Sin given by the <hi>Bleſſed Apoſtle</hi> muſt needs be infallibly true; but the reaſon offered, why the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law is ſinful, is none of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and its truth may very well be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned. For in caſe Gods Will had been abſolutely ſet againſt Sin, rather than it ſhould have been ever in the World, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Author nor Actors of it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Being, ſince he was the Maker and Creator of them both. And therefore it is not in reſpect of any Injury, Harm, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience whatſoever that can befall the Almighty, (who is infinitely above the reach of any Diſpleaſure or Annoyance poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be done unto him) by the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40186:56"/> of Sin, that he forbids it; but becauſe it is miſchievous and hurtful to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in many reſpects, as hath been ſet forth in the three preceding <hi>Sections</hi> laſt paſt. So that the Reaſon why the Creator gave Man a Law to obſerve, was not ſimply this, that he required Obedience ſhould be given to whatſoever he commanded, but that Man through Obedience to the Law (which is a Rule, that, if rightly obſerved, will make him happy) might reap the Benefit of the due Obſervance of it, as from this ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Argument will (I think) be evinced. Tho Obedience is due to be performed, but in reſpect of ſome Command given to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed; no Command is to be given to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, but in reſpect of ſome good End where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it tends; for to command a thing either to no End at all, or to a bad End, would be irrational; ſince to do the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer would be an impertinent Vanity; and to do the latter would be plain Perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; both which, ſince they are infinitely remote and eſtranged from the Nature of God, 'tis impoſſible he ſhould command a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing but for a good End. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he is utterly incapable of receiving any manner or meaſure of Good, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his infinite Self-perfection; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40186:56"/> poſſibly require Obedience from his Creature for any Good, either of Profit or Pleaſure expected to redound thereby to himſelf. And therefore whenever he gives a Law or Command to his Creature, he does it for this ſole End, that the Creature may be benefited thereby, in caſe a ſincere and cordial Obedience be performed unto it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. If God cannot poſſibly give a Command but ſuch only as tends to the Good of the Creature, it will not be in his Power to command a thing of that nature, that ſimple Diſobedience to his Will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect had to ſome or other definite Good to be obtained by fulfilling the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſhould be a ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> That God cannot poſſibly give a Command but for ſome good End and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and that he himſelf is incapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any good, hath been proved before. But it doth not thence follow, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not command a thing to be done without reſpect had to ſome or other expreſs definite Good; becauſe he may command a thing purely indifferent in it ſelf, to the intent that men by yielding Obedience to his Command for the Commands ſake, may be inured to ſubmit with readineſs and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40186:57"/> to his Will in <hi>all</hi> things, which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth, cannot fail of being at length eternally happy, becauſe the moſt of his Precepts at leaſt (as in <hi>Sect.</hi> 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. will be ſeen) are proper means in themſelves for procuring mans Felicity; which the performing of things wholly indifferent in their Nature, when enjoyned by God, (if any ſuch there be) by facilitating of Obedience will be apt to further, in that a <hi>pliableneſs</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Commands in things <hi>neceſſary</hi> will be promoted thereby. But if it were ſo that Obedience were good for the meer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſake, without reſpect had to the benefit intended to accrue to the ſincere Obſervers of it, Diſobedience would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſinful in every ſinful Act whatſoever; whence a ſmall ſtroke given in wrath would be as great a Crime as Parricide or Treaſon; to rob a poor Man of all he has, would be a Fault as ſmall, as to ſteal a Penny from the richeſt Perſon; and to commit Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Inceſt would be no greater a ſin, than a laſcivious Thought or Word, ſince all ſin without exception is abſolutely forbidden by God, and not one ſingle Crime whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever allowed to be committed. But if Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to Gods Commands be therefore
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40186:57"/> ſinful, in that it cauſes a Want or Privation of ſome good, or degree thereof, which is a Means conducible to Felicity, then is every ſin greater or leſs than other, by how much the good whereof it deprives the Soul, is more or leſs available then other for bringing it to Bliſs. And therefore although every Sin be a Tranſgreſſion of the Law, yet inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as every Branch and Title of the Law is not of equal Virtue to further Mans Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, 'tis clear that all Acts whereby the Law is tranſgreſſed are not equally bad or ſinful.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. God by the ſole Act of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or making Man out of nothing to have an Exiſtence or Being, obtained a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty over him, by virtue of which he has a Right of Dominion, or a juſt Power to lay what Commands he pleaſes upon him. Whence it muſt needs be that every Act of Diſobedience to Gods Commands is a Wrong and Injury done unto him, although the Performance of the Command would neither do him good, nor the omitting to do it procure him any harm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> That God has a Right of Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over Man, or a juſt Power to command him whatever he pleaſes, is an undeniable Truth; but the Ground thereof is not ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40186:58"/> (as the Objection would make it) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Man was created by God, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Being from him; but by reaſon alſo that ſuch is the unerrable Rectitude of his Underſtanding, and the abſolute Goodneſs of his Will that he cannot poſſibly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him any thing, but what, if duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, will infallibly procure his Good. For if God by the ſole Act of Creation (ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting from this, that he created Man from an end agreeable to his Nature, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to be obtain'd, if he obeyed the Law of his Maker) had a Right to diſpoſe of him after any manner whatſoever, without regard had to his Wiſdom and Goodneſs, (which always determine his Will to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that which is good for the Creature, ſeeing nothing can be ſo, extraſe, to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) the Almighty would have been as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nign and merciful (being ever of neceſſity the ſame, <hi>Sect. 1. Par.</hi> 8.) as he now is, if ſo be he had inflicted on all Mankind without any Demerit of theirs the moſt exquiſite and endleſs Torments; becauſe he would have been no leſs their Creator by doing that, then in ſhewing the greateſt Kindneſs imaginable. The truth of this Aſſertion, that God obtain'd not a Sovereignty over Man to command him any thing, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40186:58"/> pleaſeth him, upon the bare account of the Creation, may be ſomewhat illuſtrated, if we take into conſideration the Right which Parents have to command their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who doubtleſs are not obliged to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience upon this ſole account, that they were begotten by them; for otherwiſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience from Children to Parents would be due to be performed to them, however qualified, inſomuch that neither extream Folly, nor raging Madneſs, nor any other thing whatſoever could incapacitate them juſtly to exact at all times, and in all things, an entire Obſervance of all their Commands whatever they ſhould be, becauſe their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental Right of Dominion and Authority over them would be in all Conditions the ſame, if it only aroſe and grew from this, that they were the Iſſue of their Bodies; but who ever was known to aſſert the Duty of ſuch Obedience? The truth is, in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a Regular Power of commanding or giving Precepts to others according to the Principles and Dictates of Reaſon juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there are thoſe three things previouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required and preſumed to be in him. Firſt, A Will and Deſire to do them good. Secondly, An Underſtanding ſufficient to judge what will (at leaſt in probability)
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40186:59"/> procure their good. Thirdly, A Power enabling him to encourage them to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by propoſing a Benefit to be rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expected by their obſervance of what he commands, and on the contrary to deter them from Diſobedience by threatning Harm to befal them, if they refuſe or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to do what is enjoyned. Whence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a manifeſt Reaſon why God is always actively to be obeyed, but Human Powers are not ſo. For God through the abſolute Purity of his Nature, has a ſtedfaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Mind and Will to do good; and by reaſon of his infallible Wiſdom, a conſtant Ability to know what is good; and in virtue of his Omnipotency, a laſting indeficient Power to benefit the due Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of his Commands, and to denuntiate Evil which will infallibly befall the Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of them; whereas all Human Powers are at one time or other (or at leaſt may be) deſtitute of ſome one or more of the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Qualifications, and thereupon may command what is repugnant to ſome <hi>Moral Precept,</hi> and ſo are not neceſſarily to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively complied with in every thing they give in Command; to ſome <hi>Moral Precept,</hi> I ſay, becauſe though all <hi>Poſitive Divine Precepts,</hi> as well as <hi>Moral,</hi> are to be active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40186:59"/> obeyed, yet the Reaſon of that is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the <hi>Morality</hi> of this Truth, that it is contradictory to the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God to command any thing that will not certainly be good for him who is required to do what is commanded, if he yield a chearful Obedience thereunto. Here ſome might probably interpoſe and ſay, that Slaves and Servants are bound to obey their Lords and Maſters, and yet they do not do the things commanded for their own, but for their Lords and Maſters Profit. To this I anſwer, that Maſters of Servants, and Owners of Slaves, are not truly ſpeaking their Governours; nor is the Duty theſe owe them properly a Duty of Obedience, but of Commutative Juſtice ariſing from a mutual Contract (expreſs, or tacite) Servants ſelling their Work, either all of it, or half of it, or ſome part of it only (as their Maſters and they agree) for Hire; and Slaves part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Property of their Bodies and Goods for the ſaving of their Lives in their Enemies power to have been taken away; ſo that it is upon the account of Compact and Bargain, that Servants and Slaves are obliged to perform their Maſters and Lords Wills and Pleaſures, and not from ſtrict O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, which is properly a Duty tending
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40186:60"/> to the Advantage of thoſe who are obliged to it. If it be replied that Subjects howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver owe Obedience to their Sovereigns in a proper ſenſe, and yet Theſe ſeek their own, as well as their Peoples Benefit; I rejoyn, that ſince Sovereign Princes cannot without the Aid and Help of others, maintain their Authority (as the Almighty can do his, which makes a difference in that reſpect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and all other Governours) for the Preſervation of the People they are to rule, unleſs They themſelves be preſerved in Perſon, Power, and Wealth agreeable to their Office; it is abſolutely requiſite, that They ſhould reap ſuch Benefit by the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their Subjects, as is neceſſary to preſerve Themſelves and their Government, no leſs then the People committed to their Charge. If it be yet ſtill further urged, that admitting God cannot give a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand but only ſuch as tends to the Good of the Creature, yet it does not follow thence, that this End is the <hi>Ratio formalis,</hi> the very Reaſon of the goodneſs of the Command, but a neceſſary Conſequent only of it; for whatſoever is agreeable to the eternal Rectitude of the Divine Wiſdom to be made a Law, Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereunto muſt of neceſſity be good to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40186:60"/> Man, but ſuch a Law however is good in it ſelf, of which ſort are all the Precepts of the <hi>Moral Law.</hi> I anſwer, it is an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable Maxim, that <hi>Ceſſante ratione Legis ceſſat Lex, (i. e.</hi> as to the Equity of it, or the reaſonableneſs of its being put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for a Legiſlator may ſometimes pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently forbear the direct expreſs Repealing of a Law, tho it be not for the preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, or fit to be made uſe of) and the Reaſon of a Law evermore then ceaſeth, when it becomes unſerviceable to the End, or unuſeful to procure or further the Good for which it was made; ſo that if it were poſſible, that the <hi>Moral Law</hi> could ceaſe to be ſerviceable (to as many as uſe it aright) to the End for which it was given, namely, to advance Humane Nature towards its Perfection, by the Fruition of Mans Chief Good, it would ceaſe to be a Law. For let <hi>Aquinas</hi> be in the right, that <hi>Scientia Dei eſt cauſa ſcitorum ab ipſo,</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">ma.</hi>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40186:61"/> From which conſideration it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, why a perpetual Obligation lies upon all Men to keep the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> namely, becauſe it is at all times beneficial (if ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely obeyed) to every one for promoving his everlaſting Welfare; and not meerly becauſe it is according to the eternal Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Divine Mind, for ſo is alſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very poſitive Command of God, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God once approves of, he eternally approves of as good for what, and ſo long as he intended it; for the longer or ſhorter Continuance of any of Gods Ordinances, or Inſtitutions, or the more or leſs uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they are of towards the End to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by them, makes them neither more nor leſs agreeable to the eternal Rectitude of the Divine Wiſdom, which exactly fits every thing the Almighty inſtitutes for the Occaſion he intends it, with irreverſible Council; the whole Change which ever happens in <hi>Divine Commands,</hi> being wholly for the Creatures Sake, to whoſe variable Condition in ſeveral Ages of the World, ſeveral different Inſtitutions and Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations have been ſuited by the <hi>eternal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable</hi> Wiſdom and good Will of God; <hi>Opera mutat Deus, ſed non conſilia.</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</hi>

Secondly,</hi> That Man by Creation was placed in a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, through the Rectitude of his Intellect and Integrity of his Will, and the due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of the inferiour Faculties, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a good Conſtitution of Body, which put him in the direct Way towards the obtaining of that his Ultimate End and chiefeſt Good. (<hi>Sect. 4.) Thirdly,</hi> That by eating of the forbidden Fruit, Man fell from that Condition wherein he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40186:62"/> into a State of Sin and Miſery, the latter of which is the neceſſary conſeqent of the former. (<hi>Sect.</hi> 5, 6. and 7.) and <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> That Sin is an Averſion from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and a Converſion to the Creature, or the deſerting the Love of God for the Love of the World; (<hi>Sect.</hi> 8.) 'tis plain, that to cauſe Man to withdraw and take off his Affections from the World, and ſo to place and fix them again on God, that he ſhall at length attain to the full Enjoyment of him, <hi>in loving him with all his Heart, and with all his Soul, and with all his Mind,</hi> is to reſtore him, or to put him again into the Way, which ſhall bring him to the End for which he was created.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this could never have been ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by any Natural Means, is plain from hence, that ever ſince the native Temper of our firſt Parents Bodies was corrupted, the Objects of ſenſe, which before contributed Help and Aſſiſtance in their Kind towards the Souls Progreſs in the Love of God, wrought a contrary Effect by alluring the Senſitive Appetite to the immoderate Love of themſelves, not through any newly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Malignity in them, but becauſe the Subject receiving them was changed from
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40186:62"/> its firſt Conſtitution, which being once cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, the Diſtemper conſequent upon it (if not by ſome means corrected) would grow worſe. For Children, by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent beating of corporeal Objects on their Senſes, would be much addicted to thoſe which were grateful to the Carnal Appetite, before they grew up to the uſe of Reaſon. And when they had attained to riper years, their Bodies would be grown ſo hot, and their Paſſions thereby, eſpecially being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fomented, ſo ſtrong and violent, that they would commonly overbear and ſway their Rational Faculties. Add to this, that Men being prone to be led by the Example of thoſe they converſe with, the Vices of one another would mutually debauch, and confirm them in their inordinate Luſts; from all which, a general Neglect of God, and conſequently a groſs Ignorance of him would at length enſue. The truth of this was ſo evidently ſeen among the Gentiles, that the Knowledge of the one true God was moſtly loſt. Yea, and even thoſe of them, who had ſome right Notions of him, did not very well conſider the Enjoyment of him by Love, to be the ſole Sovereign Good of the Soul. Nor were Mens Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings only exceedingly darkened,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40186:63"/> but their Wills likewiſe very much vitiated, whilſt every one through a natural inbred deſire to be happy, frequently perſuing ſome particular fancied good or other, as Wealth, Honour, Senſual Delights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the Conſtitution of their Bodies, their Education, Converſation with others, or ſome Occaſion or Temptation they met with in the World, inclined them to, more than to any other Object, becauſe ſo eagerly bent upon their miſerable miſtaken Felicity, that tho the truly chief Good had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to their Underſtandings, yet would they not have been induced thereby to endeavour after the Fruition of it as their only Bliſs; Motives being as neceſſary for a thorow Amendment to incline the Will, as Arguments are to convince the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. For as a ſetled Judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any ſuppoſed Truth cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed without ſtronger Reaſon (at leaſt in appearance) given, than that whereby it is eſtabliſhed in the Mind; ſo neither can an Affection rooted in the Will be eradicated, but by more powerful Motives, than thoſe by which it is fixed there.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wherefore ſeeing then that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Senſe, and almoſt every thing Man is concerned with ſince the Fall, are apt, by
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40186:63" rendition="simple:additions"/> reaſon of his corrupted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> State to alienate his Affections from God, 'tis clear that Cauſes, not within the Limits of Nature, would be neceſſary to withdraw his Heart from the Love of the World, and the falſe Delights thereof, to the Love of God, if ever he ſhould arrive at Bliſs; and ſuch Cauſes as are not within the Bounds of Nature are ſupernatural. Supernatural Cauſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are neceſſary to reduce Man to the Way which leads to the End for which he was created.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And foraſmuch as Man is a Rational Creature, and cannot be moved but in a Way agreeable to his Nature, without vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence offered to the ſame, thoſe ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cauſes muſt not force him, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally draw and win him by convincing his Underſtanding of the Truth, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining his Will to the Love thereof, which are not to be effected but by Arguments and Motives. For as the impreſſion of Force is a proper Means whereby to move a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Subſtance from one place to another; ſo are Arguments and Motives proper means whereby to draw the Mind off from one Object to another. For to ſay, that a Man either aſſents to, or chuſes with Reaſon, that for which he ſees no Reaſon (general,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40186:64"/> or ſpecial) ſo to do, appears to be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; and either to aſſent unto, or to make choice of any thing without Reaſon, is repugnant to Mans Nature, which is Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and ought in all things to act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Reaſon.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To put Man therefore in the Way to glorifie God eternally, and to be for ever happy, in <hi>loving him with all the Heart, with all the Soul, and with all the Mind,</hi> is to clear his Underſtanding by convincing it, that God alone is ans Sovereign Good; and to purifie his Will by affording Motives of a nature more powerful to incline it to the Love of God; then all the Motives which the World can exhibit, are to win it to the Love thereof.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Wherefore ſince on the one ſide Mans Soul is ſenſually affected with Objects ever at hand, and eſteems nothing able to bring Contentment, but ſome or other Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Life, not only by reaſon of its own native and acquired corrupt Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but alſo from the Opinion of the World round about confirming it therein; and that on the other ſide, the Object of Mans Felicity is Spiritual, not obvious to ſenſe, and afar off, it follows, that unleſs the Object of Felicity ſhould become ſuch, as
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40186:64"/> to be put into a Condition, whereby it might be capacitated to draw Mans Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in a way agreeable and familiar to his Nature from the Love of the World to the Love of it ſelf, Man could never be brought back again to the Path of Life, but would go perpetually on in the Way which leads to Perdition.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Seeing then the goodneſs of God is ſuch, that it was inconſiſtent therewith, not to afford Means whereby Man might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from his loſt Condition; and yet not to violate his Rational Nature; 'twas neceſſary, that God, being the Object of Mans Felicity, ſhould become Incarnate and be made Man, to the intent he might fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly converſe with Man, ſoftly inſtil through his Senſes his Divine Precepts, and to do, and ſuffer ſuch things on his account, and for his ſake, as that, conſidering the Dignity of the Perſon, the unmerited and unſpeakable Kindneſs, and unvaluable Worth of the Benefit, it could not poſſibly otherwiſe fall out, but that as many, as ſhould ſeriouſly and frequently reflect and meditate thereon, would be induced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the World, and all its alluring Entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the perpetual Enjoyment of ſo great and excellent an Object, as ſo graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40186:65"/> and good a God muſt needs appear to be.</p>
               <p n="8">8. It was therefore the Almighties great Kindneſs to condeſcend to Mans Frailty, and be cloathed with his Fleſh in the ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the bleſſed Trinity, becauſe in that he is the <hi>Wiſdom of his Father,</hi> and <hi>Word of God, (Sect.</hi> 2.) 'twas an Office peculiarly proper for him to manifeſt and declare unto the World the Love which God had to Man in reconciling, or drawing him to Himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p n="9">9. To which End, <hi>Christ</hi> the Eternal Son of God did many ſignal Miracles to give ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable Teſtimony, that he was ſent from the Father, was One with him, and that the Deſign of his coming into the World, was to make up the Breach and Diſtance between God and Man, which he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly on his Part did by Teaching, by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by Suffering. For by his Doctrine he infallibly ſhewed not only the miſerable Condition which Man would eternally incur, unleſs he forſook the World, and turned to God; but alſo that God himſelf was Mans Felicity; and what Courſe he ſhould take, that he might for ever fully enjoy him. And ſeeing it was not enough that Man ſhould have his Underſtanding aright informed,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40186:65"/> unleſs his Will were likewiſe inclined to do what he ought in order to the full Enjoyment of God, <hi>Christ</hi> was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleaſed to undertake the doing and ſuffering ſuch beneficial and ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious things for him, that nothing but want of Conſideration and due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion on them could poſſibly fruſtrate their prevalent Virtue and Power over the Will, effectually to incline and turn it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, as the ſovereign good thereof. For ſince God is Man's Felicity, could any thing poſſibly be parallel'd hereunto for the merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Love, &amp; conſequently for inducing him to uſe the means available to Bliſs, that the omnipotent Creator of all things ſhould become clad with human Fleſh ſubject to Infirmities, for the ſole good of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? That he ſhould familiarly converſe with his Vaſſals, and call them Friends and Brethren, and really treat them as ſuch? That he ſhould toil himſelf both night and day in travelling from place to place to preach the glad Tidings of Salvation, to heal the Sick, to give Sight to the Blind, to make the Deaf to hear, the Dumb to ſpeak, and the Lame to walk, to comfort the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to pardon the Penitent, and in a word, to do all manner of good? Yea,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40186:66"/> and (as if all this had been a ſmall Token of his Love to man) that he ſhould be willing to ſuffer Baniſhment, Heat, Cold; Hunger, Thirſt? That he would endure to be buffeted, ſpit upon, reviled, mocked, ſcourged? That he refuſed not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go an Agony, which cauſed his precious Body to ſweat drops of Blood, and to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a moſt ignominious and painful Death? And that all this ſhould be done and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not for the leaſt advantage to the Deity, but wholly for the benefit of man, to ſave him thereby from intolerable, endleſs miſery, and to bring him, if he embraced his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and followed his Inſtructions, to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting unſpeakable Joy and Happineſs? <hi>For God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believed on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life, John</hi> 3. 16.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. X.</hi> The End of Human Laws is the Good of the Community. The Breach of them is evil, as it hinders the ſame, and not as it meerly oppoſes the Will of the Legiſlator. Every Breach of them is more or leſs evil, as it is more or leſs prejudicial to the general Good; and has in that reſpect a greater or leſs Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty aſſigned thereunto. Penal Laws are made for preventing of Evils that might happen for want of them, and not to take revenge on the Tranſgreſſor of the Law for neglecting or croſſing the Legiſlator's Will.</head>
               <p n="1">1. 'TWould be wholly frivolous and pertinent for men to make Laws, if the end for which they are made, could be had and enjoyed without the making of them; and therefore ſome End or other is deſigned in the making of all human Laws.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And foraſmuch as the End deſigned in the making of them, muſt, if the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Government (which is the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God) be not deſerted, but kept
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40186:68"/> to, be ſomething that is intended for good, 'tis plain, ſince Laws generally reſpect the whole City, Province, or Nation where they are made, that the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity (conſiſting of the governour and governed) is the general End deſigned, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Inſtitution of Government by <hi>God</hi>) in the making of human Laws.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For if to have the Legiſlator's Will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed otherwiſe than with regard had to the general good, were the End aimed at in the conſtituting of human Laws, then might the Law-giver of right enact any thing for Law, though known as well by himſelf as the People, to be deſtructive of the common good, provided it were the Legiſlator's mind to be obeyed in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of it, becauſe he would act therein what directly tended to the End of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to wit, Obedience; whereas in truth Obedience performed to the Command of the Law-giver, is a means by which the End of Government, the Public Weal or Good is to be obtained, and not the End it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laws then ought of right to deſign the common Good; and therefore every Law, as it contributes more or leſs to the benefit of the Community, is more or leſs good; and by conſequence likewiſe the Breach of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40186:68"/> every Law is a greater or leſs Evil, Fault or Crime, by how much the obſervance of the Law whereof it is a violation, is more or leſs conducible to the public Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence it follows, that Penalties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in Laws are not intended as pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for offending the Law-giver in the breaking of his Laws; but are real Branches of the ſeveral Laws wherein they are found, tending to enforce, through fear of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty to be inflicted, the performance of the thing commanded to be done or abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from, when the Laws directive part ſhall fall ſhort of attaining its End.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For ſince there will be in all places where there's need of Government, ſome good, and ſome bad people, 'tis requiſite that convenient proviſion be made by Laws, that the good deſigned to be obtained by Government, ſhould be effected and brought to paſs, as much as may be, by both ſorts. And the way to do it in reſpect of good men, is to direct them, but in reſpect of bad men, to awe them, and through the fear of Chaſtiſement, Amercement, or other Penalty, to affright them into their Duty, or to do what is beneficial to the Public; or, in caſe their Malignity be ſuch, as that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40186:69"/> there's no hope of Amendment, to remove them either by perpetual Impriſonment, or Exile, or Death, out of the way, that they may not for the future obſtruct the good which the Government labours for; and that others by their example may be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from committing the like Crimes for which they undergo the Penalty of the Law.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For that the true intent of the Law in puniſhing Offenders, is, that which hath been ſaid, will farther appear from this, that the Law authorizeth the ſupream Magiſtrate to diſpenſe with Penalties in Criminals, which of right it could not do, if meer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, or Satisfaction by way of condign Puniſhment for the Offence committed, were the thing aimed at in the enjoyning of Penalties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For to free an Offender without Satisfaction, when the Law requires Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is to do Injuſtice; which the Law, that requires Juſtice to be done, could not without contradicting it ſelf, empower him to do. But if by commanding of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be inflicted on the Tranſgreſſors of the Law, the Security of the public Peace be aimed at, then is it not only equitable, that the Penalty of a Law in ſuch caſe ſhould be remitted, when the inflicting of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40186:69"/> it is adjudged by the ſupream Governour to be leſs beneficial to himſelf and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, than the omitting the execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would be; but even Juſtice requires, that it ſhould be actually omitted, and that the perſon liable by the Letter of the Law to be puniſhed, ſhould be freed and delivered from the Penalty; which was never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Law-giver to be executed on any one to the prejudice of the Commonweal. For to diſpenſe with Penalties, is not ſo tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Act of meer Grace, as of diſtributive Juſtice, forasmuch as no Diſpenſation ought of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ght to be given, ſave only to ſuch, as the Law it ſelf would have exempted from Puniſhment, in caſe the Lawgiver had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen the Circumſtances which render their indemnity better for the Public, than their being puniſhed. So that whenever a Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to free from the Penalty of the Law, is rightly granted, the intent of that very Law is more truly fulfilled, than if the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty were inflicted; yea in truth it is only in ſo doing rightly fulfilled; the very ground and reaſon of granting Diſpenſations being this, that Penal Laws might have their due effect, <hi>viz.</hi> the Good of the Community, which in ſome Caſes and Circumſtances would by the executing them in their lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40186:70" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſenſe be prejudiced, inſtead of being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Truth of this Aſſertion, that puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice is not vindicative, will yet farther appear from this, that <hi>Lex Talionis,</hi> Eye for Eye, Tooth for Tooth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is no part of the Law of Nature, as it would of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be, in caſe Penalties for Breach of Laws were purely vindicative, and intended as ſatisfaction or juſt recompeuce for the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of them. For ſince in ſtrictneſs there's no equality or proportion between the Member of a Man's Body and the Goods of Fortune, it were unequal and un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> to recompenſe the loſs of any Limb with a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary Mulct; and yet we ſee 'tis general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo done by Chriſtians, who nevertheleſs maintain the perpetual obligation of the Law of Nature. Yea the Learned <hi>Bodin</hi> tells us upon no ſlight ground, that the <hi>Lex Talionis,</hi> in the commonly received Notion of it, was never in practice among the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Jews;</hi> his Words in the Engliſh Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation are theſe; <q rend="margSglQuotes">To requite like with like is indeed nothing elſe, but to puniſh Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences with Puniſhments anſwerable to them, that is to ſay, great Offences with great Puniſhments, mean with mean, and ſo little Offences alſo lightly; which they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40186:70"/> alſo meant when they ſaid, <hi>a Hand for a Hand, a Tooth for a Tooth, and an Eye for an Eye.</hi> And ſo the ancient <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the beſt Interpreters of God's Law, have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it, expounded it &amp; practiſed it, as it is in their <hi>Pandects</hi> to be ſeen in the Title of Penalties. Yea <hi>Rabbi Kanan</hi> denieth the Law of like Puniſhment to have any where in the Cities of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> taken place in ſuch ſort, as that he ſhould have an Eye put out who had put out another man's Eye; but the eſtimation of an Eye put out, was uſually by the diſcretion of the Judges, in money valued. For proof where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of let it be, that before the Law of like Puniſhment, there was a Law (<hi>viz. Exod.</hi> 21.) whereby it was ordained, that if two men fighting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one of them ſhould hurt the other, but not yet unto Death, he which had done the hurt, ſhould pay the Phyſician for healing thereof. But to what end ſhould he ſo pay the Phyſician, if he which did the hurt were in like ſort to be himſelf wounded? It ſhould alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of follow more abſurdly, that many deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and tender<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Perſons in receiving of ſuch Wounds, as they had given to others, ſhould thereof themſelves die and periſh. Beſides that alſo, he who had the harm done him, having loſt his I Hand where with he

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch literal Expoſition of the Law of like Puniſhment, by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Favorine,</hi> is but vain and deceitful.</q>

               <p n="9">9. I'le conclude this Point with one only Argument more for the confirmation of what has been ſaid, which is this, to inflict Puniſhment as dolorous and painful, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard had to a farther End to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the doing of it, is to do direct Evil; becauſe that Puniſhment, which has no Tendency to the procuring of ſomething which has as much or more good in it than the pain has harm (for Pain ſimply in it ſelf conſidered, is Evil, as being offenſive to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a thing occaſioned by Sin) is <hi>purum putum Malum,</hi> meer Evil; which for any Law to deſign, would argue the Makers of it to be void of Reaſon and Humanity.</p>

If the Breach of a Law be not an Offence and puniſhable, as it only ſtands in oppoſition to the Will of the Law-giver, without regard had to the Public Good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to be included in it; then are not men obliged in Conſcience to obey a bad Law, or which tends not to the Common
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40186:71"/> Good: But men are obliged in Conſcience to obey the Laws of the Land where they live, although in that reſpect bad, as not tending at all to the Public Good: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Breach of the Law is an Offence and puniſhable, as it only ſtands in oppoſition to the Will of the Law-giver, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard had to the public Good preſumed to be included in it.</p>

                  <hi>Solut.</hi> In anſwer <hi>firſt</hi> to the <hi>Major,</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, that if it were ſo, that a private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could certainly know, that a certain Law had no manner of Tendency to the Public Weal, yet would he be obliged in Conſcience to give Obedience to it, (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it were not againſt the <hi>Moral,</hi> or ſome <hi>Poſitive Divine Law</hi>) becauſe in diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying, he might be an occaſion to others of ſlighting, or contemning the Governour and Government, which is a Miſchief of moſt dangerous Conſequence to a Nation. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> I anſwer to the <hi>Minor,</hi> that no Law, which is not repugnant to ſome part of the Law of <hi>God</hi> (who, by reaſon of his inerrable Wiſdom, never commands but what is good) ought by private Perſons to be judge bad. For every Legiſlator a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, whatever way he acquires a Right to the Legiſlative Power, doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily receive with it the Sovereign or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40186:72"/> Judgment and Will, both theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo inſeparable Ingredients of the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Power, that it cannot ſubſiſt without them. For whoſo has not the Supreme Judgment, (or a Right inveſted in him to give final Judgment and Determination what is requiſite and convenient to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted for procuring the Publick Good) he wants the Knowing part of a Law-giver, or that which legally enables one finally to judge and determine what will be a proper Means for the Conſecution of the Common Good. And whoever has not the Supreme Will, (or a Right appropriated to him of enacting what is finally adjudged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be good for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal) he is deſtitute of the commanding part of a Law-giver, or that which legally empowers one to paſs, what is determinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adjudged requiſite for procuring the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Good, into a Law. Which things being preſuppoſed to be true, the Inference from them will be neceſſarily this; That no Law enacted by a Sovereign Power can in Reaſon be ſaid by any private Perſon to be bad, or not tending to the Public Good, (if it be not manifeſtly contrary to his Law whoſe Judgment is infallible.) For in that he has the Legiſlative Power, he is of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40186:72"/> ſuppoſed to have the Supreme Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo that no inferior Judgment (as the Judgment of every Subject, there being but one Supreme in one Government, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily is) can without manifeſt Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Reaſon judge that he judges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs.</p>

If Laws be therefore obliging, becauſe preſumed to be good; ſince it is certain, that no Command can be good which is oppoſite to Gods Law, it would follow, that no manner of Obedience, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Active or Paſſive, is due to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Sovereigns, which are againſt the Moral, or a Divine Poſitive Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> If to do a thing commanded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe commanded to be done, be to obey a Command, then to refuſe to do a thing commanded, is to diſobey a Command, and how a Man ſhould at the ſame time both obey and diſobey the ſame Command, I underſtand not. Actively, you'l ſay, he cannot do both at once; but may he not refuſe to give an active Obedience to an unjuſt Command, and yet at the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant be willing and ready to ſuffer for that his Refuſal, in caſe it be required, that he ſhould either actively obey, or undergo the Penalty enjoyned for not ſo obeying? I
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40186:73"/> anſwer that there is no Law can oblige a Man to be willing to ſuffer for not actively obeying what is unlawful to be done; for by what Law is it poſſible he ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged? Not by the Law of God, for that commanding him not to yield an Active O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, cannot alſo enjoyn him to be willing to ſuffer for no other Cauſe, but that he obſerves what is commands. Nor by the Law of Reaſon, for how ſhould this oblige him to be willing to be puniſhed for Nor-obſervance of that, which it tells him he ought not to obſerve? Some of the Roman Emperors ſet forth Edicts that the Chriſtians ſhould either Sacrifice to their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol-gods, or be put to Death; the Active fulfilling of which unjuſt Commands, was to do Sacrifice, the Paſſive to be put to Death; and yet divers good and godly Chriſtians fled on purpoſe to avoid both; and doubtleſs did no wrong therein, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warranted by Chriſt himſelf, ſaying, <hi>When they perſecute you in this City, flee ye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, Matth.</hi> 10. 23.) albeit they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwered the Letter of the Edicts, nor the Intention of the Emperors, which was that one of the two (either ſacrificing or ſuffering Death for not ſacrificing) ſhould be done. (And by the way this is a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40186:73"/> Inſtance, that Diſobedience to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is not an Offence, as it meerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the Will of the Legiſlator.) But there is not however the leaſt Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be gathered from hence for Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or forcibly oppoſing the Higher Powers; for tho there be no manner of Obedience due to an unjuſt Command; (for that Command which is unjuſt, has no obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Virtue in it, but is unlawful, that is, truly ſpeaking, no Law.) Yet in that a Sovereign looſes not, by commanding ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is unjuſt, his Legiſlative Power or a Right to command whatſoever he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately thinks to be for the general Good, which is not againſt the Divine Law, Moral or Poſitive, he ought not to be forcibly withſtood. For whoſoever has by Law the Supreme Judgment and Will (which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſtitute the Supreme Power) the ſame Law preſumes that the common Safety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on his Government; and therefore without violating of the Law, and through that the Common Safety, the Sovereign is not even in the Abuſe of Government to be oppoſed by Arms, becauſe it is more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in reſpect of the Whole, that ſome Part ſuffer unjuſtly, than that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf ſhould be rendred uſeleſs, or ſo
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40186:74"/> obſtructed that it could not protect and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Laws, which it is always preſumed by the Law will fall out, when Subjects with Violence oppoſe the Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>

Albeit the <hi>Lex Talioni</hi> be no part of the Law of Nature; yet ſeeing it is not diſagreeable thereunto, (as 'tis evident by the Inſtance of <hi>Adonibezek, Judges</hi> 1. 6, 7. that it is not) does it not rightly follow, that Puniſhments may be juſtly Vindicative, though they are not neceſſarily ſo?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No it does not, for notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it may be reaſonable at ſometimes to take an Eye for an Eye, a Hand for a Hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet will not Vindicative Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment be found thereupon to be lawful; for if the taking Eye for Eye, Hand for Hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be at any time prudently thought by a Law-giver to be the beſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient either for reclaiming Offenders, or for terrifying others, or for both, (as it may peradventure on occaſion fall out to be) the exerciſe of that Strictneſs will be juſt, yet not Vindicative. For that which Men will have to be Vindicative Juſtice looks not at all forward, but wholly back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, being purely deſign'd and intended for Recompenſe or Satisfaction, for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40186:74"/> Injury, or Contempt done to the Law-giver in diſobeying his Will, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating his Law; whence Vengeance execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon a Tranſgreſſor of the Law is the very End and Scope which Vindicative Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment aims at, and therefore the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Adonibezek</hi> was not vindicative, unleſs it was inflicted on him for no other end, ſave only to repay like for like, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intention that it ſhould be a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to him of Repentance, or that others might be warned to abſtain from ſuch Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, as he had uſed, by the remarkable manner of his being plagued himſelf, as he had plagued others; which cannot in reaſon be thought to be true, becauſe <hi>Adonibezek</hi> ſaith, <hi>As I have done, ſo God hath requited me;</hi> which ſhews that the manner of his Puniſhment proved a Motive of bringing his Sin to remembrance, and was either ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be, or elſo to deter others from the like Wickedneſs, or rather for both; and not barely for ſtrict Retaliation or executing of Vengeance upon him for his Crime.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In fine, then it appears from what has been ſaid of Human Laws, and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Sovereign Powers make not Laws out of meer deſign to have their
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40186:75"/> Wills obeyed, but to procure their own, and their Subjects Good. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Laws therefore are more or leſs good, as they contribute more or leſs to the general Good. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That hence again the Breach of any Law is a greater or leſs Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as it is more or leſs prejudicial to the Common-weal. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That from this it moreover follows, that Penalties inſerted in Laws are not intended as pure Revenge for the Breach of them, but to be a means to enforce the obſerving the directive Part of the Law. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That Laws duly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted are proper Ways, or real Cauſes of advancing the Public Good.</p>
               <p n="11">11. From the Conſideration of all which concerning Human Laws compared with what was writ before (<hi>Sect.</hi> 8.) of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Laws, the Analogy between them is obvious; and the Certainty of theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Truths apparent. <hi>First,</hi> That God gave Man a Law to obſerve, not that he ſought to be obeyed for the meer Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake, but that Man by obeying it might benefit himſelf in obtaining the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his chiefeſt Good. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That becauſe of this, the ſeveral Branches of that Law are of more or leſs virtue and value, as they are more or leſs ſerviceable for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40186:75"/> the Fruition of the ſame Sovereign Good. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That from hence again it muſt be, that the Breach of any part of the Divine Law is a greater or leſs Evil, or (in the Language of Divines) a greater or leſs Sin, as the keeping of it is more or leſs available towards the Enjoyment of God. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That it will hereupon follow, that the Puniſhment of Sin is not vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but always, either corrective for the Amendment of the Offender, or exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for a Terror to others, or for both; as in this World it perpetually is; or elſe a neceſſary and natural Product and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of Sin, as it is ever in the World to come. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That the keeping of Gods Law, or the pious Practice of Virtue and Holineſs is a proper effective Means, or an efficacious Cauſe of Mans Eternal Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; the truth of which ſhall hereafter (God aſſiſting) be ſhown in particular, as it hath already been in general.</p>

               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:40186:76"/>2. And becauſe Men arrive not at the certain Knowledg of things but either by Demonſtration which begets Science; or by an inerrable Teſtimony, which creates an infallible Belief, 'tis clear, ſeeing a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration wherein Felicity conſiſts (tho it be a thing in it ſelf demonſtrable, as appears by <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.) cannot by the generality of Mankind be attained unto; much leſs, wherein all the Means available to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Felicity (ſome of them being po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive and ſupernatural) are placed, that a Revelation from God, who alone is inerra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, was neceſſary for the Diſcovery both of the Means of Bliſs, and of Bliſs it ſelf, to the World, in order to Man's acquiring of Beatitude.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And foraſmuch as that Knowledg which proceeds from, and is cauſed by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, is Divine Belief or Faith, 'tis plain that Divine Faith is required on Man's part towards the obtaining of Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And in regard it is ineffectual to the obtaining of Felicity to have firm Belief only wherein it truly conſiſts, and what the Means available to procure it are, without ſome farther Progreſs made towards the getting poſſeſſion of it; which will never be,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40186:77"/> unleſs a man have Hope by reaſon of the Divine Promiſe, that in the due uſe of the means of Bliſs he ſhall acquire the ſame, 'tis plain, that Divine Hope is likewiſe requiſite as well as Faith for every one that ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally be ſaved.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And foraſmuch as he that has a right Belief both of Bliſs and the Means available to it; and withal, an Aſſurance that in the due uſe of the Means, Felicity will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by him, ſhall reap no Benefit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, if he never enter upon a reſolved ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Courſe of making a conſtant diligent uſe of thoſe Means; which he moſt certainly will not do, unleſs he firſt have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned ardent deſire to enjoy the End whereto they tend, the eternal Fruition of God, 'tis evident, that the ſincere and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty love of God, or Charity proceeding from Faith and Hope, (for no good Man ſtedfaſtly deſires what he believes not to be true, or has no Hope to obtain) is moreover neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the acquirment of Felicity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And ſeeing the habitual Love of God above all things is utterly inconſiſtent with the habitual Love of the World above God, 'tis manifeſt, that by the acceſſion of the habitual Love of God above all things into the Soul, the habitual Love of the World
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40186:77"/> above God is neceſſarily expelled, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that Sin, (whether taken priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively as an Averſion from God, or poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively for a Converſion to the Creature) which brings everlaſting Death and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; (<hi>Sect.</hi> 7.) whence it is called mortal and damnable Sin.</p>

               <p n="8">8. And foraſmuch as he that is ſecured from the Danger of Damnation, and the Pains of Hell, is freed from the Guilt of mortal Sin, which is a liableneſs to be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally damned and tormented for Sin, and that he who is freed from the Guilt of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sin, is blameleſs and innocent in reſpect of the mortal Breach of the Law, which alone creates a mortal Guilt; and that he who is blameleſs and innocent in reſpect of the mortal Breach of the Law, is a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Perſon, or acquit by the Law from
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40186:78"/> the Puniſhment due in reſpect of ſuch Breach; it neceſſarily follows, that Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in regard it formally expells mortal Sin, (the mortal Breach of the Law) is formal Righteouſneſs, or the formal Cauſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, being that which formally juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and makes Righteous.</p>

For he that loves God with all the Might and Power of his Soul, hath thereby of neceſſity totally rooted out of it all the love of the World, and ſo hath no Sin, but is perfectly Righteous, and hath fulfilled the Great Commandment, or Royal Law; <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind,</hi> which to do is compleat Righteouſneſs, the higheſt Act of glorifying God, and eternal Felicity.</p>

Whence in very truth, thoſe men, who in attributing man's formal Righteouſneſs to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt made his by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation through Faith, think they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute more to Chriſt, and give him greater honour than they do, that hold the ſincere habitual love of God to be the formal cauſe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40186:80"/> of Juſtification, are under a manifeſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake. For ſince Chriſt is perſonally God, and not perſonally Man, and that the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite value of his precious merits is from the hypoſtatical. Union of his Manhood with the Deity, 'tis plain, that it is far more excellent and glorious that Chriſt's righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs (which comprehends the whole merit of all his active and paſſive Obedience) ſhould be the efficient Cauſe of man's Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by producing a real habitual Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his Soul, than the formal cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by a meer imputed Righteouſneſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch imputed Righteouſneſs (in caſe it were poſſible) would be the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt as man (for otherwiſe a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous perſon would be infinitely righteous, and conſequently be God, ſince nothing is infinitely perfect in any reſpect whatever, but he alone) whereas if his Righteouſneſs be the efficient Cauſe of man's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is proper to him as he is both God and Man. But indeed it is impoſſible that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs ſhould become for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally man's; for ſeeing it is perſonal, and thence a thing extrinſecal to every one but himſelf, 'tis not poſſible to become a formal Cauſe to others, in that a formal Cauſe, whether it be ſubſtantial, or accidental, is
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40186:81"/> an internal Cauſe, and eſſentially conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the thing whereof it is a Cauſe. For inſtance, Man's Soul is the formal Cauſe, and a ſubſtantial eſſential part of man, as man, or a rational Animal. Prudence is the formal Cauſe, and an accidental eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of man, as he is prudent; and ſo is Temperance of a temperate man; and every Abſtract elſe of the Concrete to which it is appropriated. For what is a prudent man, but one habitually indued with Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? or a temperate man, but one whom the habit of Temperance formally makes ſuch? And muſt not a righteous perſon by parallel Reaſon be one habitually poſſeſſed of Righteouſneſs? If it were not thus, but that on the contrary, a prudent man could be prudent by the Prudence of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without the Habit of Prudence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf, then were it poſſible that a man might be prudent, though really imprudent in all his doings, and ſo be prudent and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly imprudent at once. And if a man could be temperate without the Virtue of Temperance inherent in him, he might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be temperate, when he wallowed in the Sink of all filthy Pleaſures, and thence be temperate and not at all temperate at the ſame time. And ſo in like manner, if a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40186:81"/> man could be righteous by the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of another, without any inherent Righteouſneſs of his own, he might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at the ſame inſtant be righteous and a notorious Tranſgreſſor of God's Law, and conſequently be a juſt and unjuſt perſon, a Sinner and no Sinner both together. If it were replied, that God always in the very moment wherein Chriſt's Righteouſneſs through Faith is imputed to any man, infuſes entire holineſs into his Soul, ſo that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly keeps every Divine Precept; I would make this Return; Admitting it were ſo, (which yet I think, may modeſtly enough be denied) the Doctrine of imputative Righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would be never a whit the more true; becauſe inasmuch as it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily implies in it, that a man might poſſibly be (if God would permit it) an abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly righteous and unrighteous perſon at once, (though it never actually fell out to be ſo) it ſuppoſes a poſſibility of two contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Aſſertions to be both true together.</p>
               <p>But it is farther argued againſt imputative Righteouſneſs thus; If man be made for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally righteous by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, then is man truly righteous, abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from every thing which he himſelf doth more than what is neceſſary on his part for
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40186:82"/> applying Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to his Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith, or a ſtedfaſt Belief that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is made his; (according to ſome) or a Recumbence or reſting on Chriſt for Salvation; (as others will have it.) But man is not truly righteous abſtracting from every thing he himſelf doth more than what is neceſſary on his part for applying Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to his Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> Faith, or a Recumbence on Chriſt for Salvation: <hi>Ergo,</hi> Man is not made formally righteous by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. The truth of the <hi>Propoſition</hi> being evident, I prove the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> thus; If a real and hearty turning from Sin, or the love of the world to the love of God, be neceſſary to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, then is not man truly righteous ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting from every thing he himſelf doth more than a ſtedfaſt Belief that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is made his, or a Recumbence on Chriſt for Salvation: But a real and hearty turning from Sin, or the love of the world to the love of God, is neceſſary to Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: <hi>ergo,</hi> man is not truly righteous ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting from every thing he himſelf doth more than a ſtedfaſt Belief that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is made his; or a Recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bence on Chriſt for Salvation. The <hi>Minor</hi> (which alone can be doubted of) proved;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40186:82"/> If Chriſt's imputed Righteouſneſs be not ſufficient, without a real and hearty turning from Sin, or the love of the world to the love of God, to free the Soul from deadly Sin, and the Conſequent of it, eternal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, then is a real and hearty turning from Sin, or the love of the world to the love of God, neceſſary to Juſtification: But Chriſt's imputed Righteouſneſs is not ſufficient with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a real hearty turning from Sin, or the love of the world to the love of God, to free the Soul from deadly Sin, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of it, Eternal Miſery: <hi>Ergo,</hi> A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and hearty turning from Sin, or the love of the world to the love of God, is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Juſtification. The <hi>Major</hi> needs no Proof; and the <hi>Minor</hi> is evidently true, if deadly Sin be nothing elſe but the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Enjoyment of the World before the Enjoyment of God, or an Averſion from God, and Converſion to the Creature; and that everlaſting Miſery is the neceſſary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of the perpetual Continuance in Sin, according to what is ſaid in the <hi>7th.</hi> and <hi>8th. Section.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, The Doctrine of imputative Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs ſeems erroneous from what here follows. If men be formally juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt made theirs,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40186:83"/> then are all men juſtified alike, or have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Righteouſneſs, (becauſe Chriſts Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is one and the ſame) and if juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied alike, then alſo glorified alike, ſeeing Glory depends on Righteouſneſs, or rather is compleat Righteouſneſs it ſelf, or the perfect love of God in Heaven, (<hi>Par.</hi> 9.) But all men are not glorified alike, therefore neither juſtified alike. That all men are not glorified alike, I gather thus: The perfect or entire love of God without any mixture of Affection to any thing beſides, as the Souls Sovereign Good, being Mans Felicity, (for tho the Bleſſed Saints and Angels mutually delight in each other, and more or leſs, according to every ones Excellency; yet it is only as they are and appear, ſo many bright Rayes iſſuing from the Sun of Glory, and not as having any proper independent Lovelineſs of their own, or Excellency which is not totally derived from God) it will be ſo, that if, of two enjoying Bliſs, the one love God more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſly and vigorouſly than the other, (tho both with their whole Affection, for ſo do all the glorified Saints and Angels) he will be the more happy; for he that more intenſly and vigorouſly affects or takes Delight in the Object he enjoys, muſt of neceſſity have
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40186:83"/> more Joy, Pleaſure and Contentment, then he that adheres to what he loves with leſs ardency of Affection. This being clear, let's compare in our Minds the Intenſneſs or Vigor of Love to God wherewith the Holy Virgin, the Bleſſed Apoſtles, and Pious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, or any of them, particularly the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> departed this Life, with that remiſs, but ſincere Affection which ſome other good Chriſtian has to God when he leaves this World, and we ſhall eaſily perceive there muſt needs be a great Diſproportion of their love to God. When therefore the Beatific Object ſhall be preſented to both, their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections will be encreaſed proportionably to what they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t from hence with, as for Example, ſuppoſe the Bleſſed Virgin depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Life with an Affection to God in compariſon of what the other had at his Departure, as five is in proportion to two; then in caſe his Affection which ſtood in proportion to the Virgins as two to five be raiſed by the fight of God to the degree of five, hers will be advanced thereby to the degree of eight, for why the Beatific Object, ſince it is able to give infinitely more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction than Mans Nature is capable of, ſhould augment the one and not the other proportionably, I ſee no appearance of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40186:84"/> Affections thereof; for as the Strength of the Body is placed in the Nerves, ſo is the ſtrength of the Soul, in relation to Objects of the Will, in its Affections; the Vigour of which, the more the Mind is ſet upon any thing it deſires, and employed in the Contemplation of it, is the more augmented; like as the ſtrength of the Sinews is encreaſed by the Exerciſe of the Body. Wherefore ſince our gracious God <hi>will reward every one according to his Works, Matth.</hi> 16. 27. and that no Work is acceptable to him which is not done for the love of him, or out of a deſire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him eternally; it follows in all reaſon, that, ſeeing God himſelf is the Reward of the Ever-bleſſed, and that therefore the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Rewards muſt proceed from the difference of the manifeſtation of his Glory, he will manifeſt Himſelf proportionably to the Ardency of deſire which every one has to enjoy him; and conſequently, that they who love him moſt here (in that they moſt ſon likely to be given. If it be ſaid that every glorified Saint loves God with all his Might, and conſequently, that, ſeeing one mans Soul differs not in Effence from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, every one will love God alike in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: I anſwer, that to love God with all the Might of the Soul, is to love him with all the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40186:84"/> deſire the perpetual Enjoyment of Him) will alſo love him moſt hereafter; for exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of the Manifeſtation of Gods Glory both to the Saints and Angels, is the Meaſure of their Love of Him, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light taken in the Contemplation of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, and in this conſiſts their Felicity; which though it is ſufficient and ſatisfactory to every one of them, inaſmuch as they all love him with their entire Affection, or are delighted in him with all their might, and ſo are happy to their own Deſire; yet do they not however enjoy equal Happineſs, becauſe the love of God in ſome of them is more intenſe than in ſome others, as anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a fuller manifeſtation of his Glory to them.</p>

If the formal Cauſe of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be inherent Righteouſneſs or Charity, then doth every degree thereof truly juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, ſo that man's Righteouſneſs may be greater or leſs, and conſequently either eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degree of Righteouſneſs will not give a juſt Title to Heaven, ſo as Poſſeſſion ſhall ever enſue thereupon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or elſe imperfect Charity ſhall eſtate men in everlaſting Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, which is contrary to what hath been often ſaid.</p>

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40186:85"/> from the dead. If it be ſaid (as indeed it is by ſome) that Chriſt's appearing to the Souls of good men that departed this Life before his Death, muſt needs have been a Motive and Cauſe of Change unto them; whence it came to paſs that the <hi>Graves were opened, and many Bodies of the Saints, which ſlept, aroſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 52, 53. I anſwer; that ſince it is here ſuppoſed, that there had been no Motive offered before that his ſhewing himſelf to them, which had alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtate into which they entered at their ſeparation from the Body, it is reaſonable to think, that there will likewiſe be no Motive to cauſe a Change in thoſe which have left, or ſhall leave this World after that his appearing, till his coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the laſt day; which in that it muſt needs, in ſome degree or other, be both dreadful and amiable to every one that hath not totally rooted out all Affection to the World, according to their different Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Fear and Hope ariſing from their finding themſelves more or leſs clogged with terrene Deſires, will be a Motive rightly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted wholly to purge out all the Dreggs of impure Affections, and ſo cauſe them to fix their Minds for ever upon God. But in the <hi>intenim</hi> they'l continue in that condition,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40186:86"/> which they left the World with; and ſo each of them, as their Love to God is greater, will have more and purer Delight, yet not be altogether void of anguiſh of Spirit, by reaſon they cannot go immediately to God through the load of Sin, which though not ſo heavy as to preſs them down to Hell, yet will not ſuffer them to ſoar up to Heaven. For we ſee even in this Life, the more Pious that men are, the more ſerene Joy, and greater inward Contentment they enjoy, but have not withſtanding their Groans and Sighs, and trouble of Spirit, becauſe they find the Old Man is not throughly conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſubdued; and however brought low, is nevertheleſs often giving check to their Spiritual Joy, and cauſing their Grief. Nor is an incompleat imperfect State after this Life till the Day of Doom only conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Reaſon; but the Sacred Scripture alſo, and Catholic Tradition appear to make for it; for what mean theſe <hi>Expreſſions of being recompenſed at the Reſurrection of the Juſt, Luke 14. 14. Of the Spirit being ſaved in the Day of the Lord Jeſus, 1 Cor. 5. 5. Of finding Mercy of the Lord in that Day, 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 18. but that ſomething is to be received at the Day of Judgment not to be obtained before? Which the practical Tradition of

But notwithſtanding this,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40186:88"/> ſeeing Man is neither converted, nor perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veres in Grace, nor goes to Bliſs, (that is, neither obtains Charity, nor keeps Charity, nor is perfected in Charity) without his own voluntary Conſent, 'tis apparent that the Merits of Chriſt are the efficient Cauſe of Mans eternal Welfare, by really and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually working, preſerving and perfecting the Love of God in the Soul; whilſt by Chriſts Heavenly Doctrine Mans underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is divinely illuminated with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of ſaving Truth, and through that, and the ſerious Conſideration of his gracious and wonderful Actings and Sufferings in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Man, his Will is powerfully conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God. Foraſmuch then as ſincere ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Charity deſtroys mortal Sin, (<hi>Par.</hi> 6.) and thereupon ſo far brings Man in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God, or ſo near to him, that he is freed from everlaſting Deſtruction (<hi>Par.</hi> 7.) and that perfect Charity wholly extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates all Sin, (<hi>Par.</hi> 9.) and thereby conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes Man in full favour, or throughly unites him to God, is it not clear and evident that <hi>Chriſt</hi> in cleanſing the Soul through his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> from Sin, makes up the Breach it had cauſed between God and Man, and ſo <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciles</hi> and brings them again together?

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40186:89"/> the Breach and Diſtance between God and Man, (and that when nothing elſe was able to do it, <hi>Sect.</hi> 9.) is he not on good grounds ſaid to have made a <hi>full Atonement,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> for Sin? Not that God was ever affected with Anger, and his Wrath really appeaſed, it being impoſſible that there ſhould be any alteration or change in God, who is immutable, (<hi>Sect. 1. Par.</hi> 8.) and without all <hi>variableneſs or ſhadow of turning, James</hi> 1. 17. So that God loved us even when we were <hi>Sinners,</hi> and <hi>Enemies, Rom.</hi> 5. 8, 10. and St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his. Son to be the Propitiation for our Sins, 1 John</hi> 4. 10. Wherefore ſince there was no want of Love (to wit, of Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, for with the love of Complacency or Delight, God cannot affect Sinners) in the Almighty, towards the making up the Breach and Diſtance between himſelf and man, the whole failure of Love was on mans ſide, whoſe Heart in that it was ſo faſt wedded and glued to the World, that neither the Conſideration of the glorious and gracious Work of the Creation, nor of the great and daily Mercy of Divine Providence, proved Motives prevalent enough to make a Divorce and Separation between them, ſome more potent Motive was neceſſary for
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40186:90"/> the doing of it. And becauſe every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt needs fall infinitely ſhort of afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a Motive, man had never been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from his loſt Condition to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the end of his Creation, if <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> had not undertaken the great, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe inſuperable Work of his Recovery, by being made Man, and in doing and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering what he did to regain his Love. And therefore laſtly, whereas <hi>Chriſts bloody Death and Paſſion</hi> was the ſtrongeſt and moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing Argument and Motive of all other Teſtimonies of his ſtupendious Love to man, for drawing his Affections off from the Love of the World to the Love of God, which is the purging away of Sin, the <hi>ſhedding of Christs pretious Blood on the Croſs</hi> is ſaid to be a <hi>Sacrifice for Sin,</hi> that is, for the putting or taking away of Sin, even as the ſacred Text it ſelf directly aſſerteth, <hi>He appeared to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf, Hebr.</hi> 9. 26. Hence it is that mans Redemption and Salvation are ſo frequently attributed to <hi>Chriſts Death on the Croſs,</hi> it being the moſt remarkable Inſtance of his Love, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the potenteſt Motive of all others, to win mans firm Affection to himſelf. For that our Bleſſed Saviours Incarnation, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he either did or ſuffered in his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood

If, after all the Endeavour that hath been uſed to frame Arguments, to ſolve Objections, and to explicate how mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, Reconciliation and Salvation are in a true ſcriptural Senſe wrought by Chriſt, for clearing the Aſſertion, that the ſincere habitual Love of God, or Charity, is the Formal Cauſe of Juſtification, it be found, that the Aſſertion it ſelf is repugnant to the <hi>11th.

                  <hi>Solut.</hi> That Chriſt's Doings and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (which conſtitute his Merit) are a real Cauſe of mans Juſtification, has been both
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40186:91"/> aſſerted and proved in this Section; ſo that if any difference be between what the <hi>11th.

And yet even as to this alſo there will be found no difference, when the matter is well diſcuſſed. For I ſtedfaſtly hold and maintain together with the <hi>Article,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt's Merit</hi> is apprehended and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to a Sinner for his Juſtification <hi>by Faith only,</hi> whilſt he firmly believes, that God through them, will, according to his free Promiſe in the Goſpel, deliver him from the Slavery of Sin, and the Conſequent of it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Miſery; ſo that in regard it is the Grace of Faith <hi>alone</hi> which draws the <hi>Merit</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> home to a Chriſtians Soul, whence it becomes an effectual Motive to gain his Affections in turning them from the falſe Pleaſures of the World unto God the ſole true Delight of the Soul, (which is to be an efficient Cauſe of cleanſing the Heart from Sin through Charity) it muſt needs be, that in this ſenſe <hi>we are juſtified for the Merit of Chriſt by Faith only.</hi> And that the <hi>11th. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi> of Religion is to be underſtood in this ſenſe, ſeems clear, both from the words
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40186:91"/> wherein it is expreſſed, and from the Churches <hi>Homily</hi> referred to for a fuller ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of what they intend. The words of the Article are theſe, <hi>We are accounted righteous before God, only for the Merit of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, and not for our own Works or Deſervings. Wherefore that we are juſtified by Faith alone, is a moſt wholſome Doctrine, and very full of Comfort, as more largely is expreſſed in the Homily of Justification.</hi> Here 'tis plain, that our <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour</hi> is affirmed to be the meritorious Cauſe of Juſtification, and it is undeniably true, that aſwell <hi>Divines</hi> as <hi>Philoſophers</hi> place a <hi>Meritorious</hi> Cauſe among the <hi>efficient Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> whence the learned Prelate <hi>Forbeſius</hi> writeth thus, <q rend="margDblQuotes">

And therefore although there be peradventure ſome Precepts in <hi>Moſe</hi>'s Law, which are ſo purely arbitrary, as to be fulfilled in the meer willing obſervance of them; yet God's Deſign in inuring the <hi>Jews</hi> to Acts of ſimple Obedience, was queſtionleſs this, that they might be the more willing and ready to obey him in thoſe things which directly made for their eternal Good. For to give a Command without an intention of Good, in ſome reſpect or other, to man, by the performance of it, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Reaſon, and contradictory to the wiſdom and goodneſs of God (<hi>Sect. 8.

But beſides it is not a thing eaſily to be granted, that the <hi>Temporal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40186:96"/> Law</hi> were ſo purely arbitrary, as they ſeem upon a ſlight view to be. For ſince all good Laws reſpect man's Good, that his chief Good is the perfect Love of God, and that every thing beſides is only for good to him as it contributes in ſome reſpect or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thereunto, (<hi>Sect. 5. Par.</hi> 1.) it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follows, that all Laws given by God to Man, were intended to be a means of bringing him by the obſervance of them, to the love of himſelf, as his ſole ſovereign good; and by conſequence, that the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical</hi> Law was given to the <hi>Jews</hi> to win that People by ways <hi>convenient</hi> and <hi>agreeable</hi> to their <hi>Tempers,</hi> to ſet their <hi>Affections</hi> on God. For though the Motives which it propoſed were Promiſes and Threats of temporal Rewards and Puniſhments; and the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of it moſtly certain Rites and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; yet were they truly ſuitable to that Nation, whoſe Hearts were generally groſs and childiſh, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely hints, ſaying, <hi>Till the fulneſs of time was come, the</hi> Jews <hi>were as Children in Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage under the Rudiments of the World,</hi> Gal. 4. 3. that is, I conceive, as Children are firſt taught their Rudiments, becauſe not capable of better Learning till of riper years; ſo were the <hi>Jews</hi> inſtructed by weak and poor

For we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from thence, that if God had told them by his Servant <hi>Moſes</hi> of <hi>Spiritual Joys</hi> they ſhould have <hi>after this life,</hi> inſtead of the <hi>good Land of</hi> Canaan <hi>flowing with Milk and Honey,</hi> if they would obey and keep his Commandments and Statutes, ſuch Doctrin would have found ſmall Acceptance; the Truth of which, if perchance queſtioned becauſe of the Conſtancy of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captives in their Religion; this, I think, may well ſuffice for Anſwer, that part of the Prophecy which told of their carrying to <hi>Babylon</hi> being fulfilled, gave them aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that as the violation of the Law had occaſioned their bringing into Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo their cloſe adherence to it for the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40186:97"/> future, would procure their own, or their Poſterities Reſtorement to their Native Countrey and Freedom. Seeing then the Hearts of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were ſuch, as that the moſt <hi>connatural</hi> way to bring them to love God, was by delivering them from Servitude and bodily Dangers; and by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of temporal Good, and Threats of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Evil; 'tis plain, the love of worldly good things was ſo ſetled in their Minds, that the Almighty ſought not to be beloved by excluding the love of them out of their Hearts, but by gaining their Affections through them; whilſt he endeavoured to manifeſt, that <hi>the whole Earth was his, and the fulneſs thereof,</hi> to the end they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on his Bounty, and love him for the ſame; which whoſoever of them really did, God acquired thereby a <hi>Pre-eminence</hi> in their Affections, foraſmuch as the due Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration thereof would beget a greater love of the <hi>Giver</hi> than of the <hi>Gift.</hi> For whoſe ſeriouſly reflects that all Good comes from God, and that the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of it proceeds from his bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Kindneſs without any precedent Merit on man's part, muſt needs acknowledg his <hi>Gracious Goodneſs</hi> to be ſuch, as that he ought to relie thereon as the <hi>Sovereign Good</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:40186:98"/> and <hi>Fountain</hi> from which, whatſoever he enjoys, flows; and in ſo doing his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will be carried thereto accordingly, that is <hi>chiefly</hi> and above all Earthly things. Thus we ſee the Reaſon of the Motives to the Love of God <hi>peculiar</hi> to the <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Temporal Ordinances, Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> of whoſe Law alſo, however they may ſeem at firſt ſight to have been Commands rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only to a bare Obedience required in the performance of them, were in very deed <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>fit Means</hi> to keep the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation from Idolatry, and to make them obſerve the ſubſtantial part of the Law, which was to love God above all things, and their Neighbour as themſelves. Hence the Ordinances of the Paſchal Lamb and of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened Bread, were inſtituted for Helps to keep God's wonderful Mercy and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them, in freeing them from the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Bondage, in perpetual remembrance; that they might ever be reminded to praiſe, laud and magnifie him, and conſequently to love him for the ſame. Hence their Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Oblations for Sin, were ordained to bring their Tranſgreſſions to mind, that they ſhould acknowledg them, and turn from them by Repentance to God. Yea and the ſeemingly inſignificant Ceremonious
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40186:98"/> rites were appointed as things uſeful for walls of ſeparation between the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> round about them, to withold them from their Idolatries, wicked practices of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Superſtitions and Whoredoms frequent among them; for they ſtood in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the cuſtoms of the Nations adjoyning to the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> as we are aſſured from Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men out of <hi>Maimon</hi> (for I never had a ſight of his Writings my ſelf) who proveth out of ancient Books that the Precepts of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Law</hi> of this kind are ſtill with a <hi>Reflex</hi> upon the <hi>Heathen Rites,</hi> and not of thoſe only of ſimple Idolatry, but moſt of all ſuch as were complicated with magical and unreaſonable Superſtition; and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of thoſe Laws were not ſo large and indiſtinct as to look on all the Heathens in <hi>general,</hi> but in <hi>particular</hi> to the <hi>Egyptians, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites, Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Amorites.</hi> Yea, the ſame Author, it is ſaid, hath reconciled the ſtrangeneſs of the Ceremonial Precepts to any man's proportion of Reaſon and Belief; of which I'le produce one Inſtance: <q rend="margDblQuotes">It is forbidden that any man of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould eat Blood. Alſo it is commanded that the Blood be ſprinkled on the Altar, and moreover, that it be covered with duſt, or ſpilt on the ground as water. Some of the <hi>Zabii</hi> did
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40186:99"/> uſe to eat the Blood, ſome others, who reckoned this to inhumanity, at the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a Beaſt reſerved the Blood, and gathered it up into a Veſſel or Trench, and then ſitting down in a Circle about the Blood, they ate up the Fleſh, and ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves with an Opinion that their Daemons fed upon the Blood, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtrong Conceit that this manner of ſitting at the ſame Table with their Gods, would engage them to a nearer Tye of Converſation and Familiarity, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to themſelves alſo that the Spirits would inſinuate themſelves in Dreams, and render them capable of Prophecy, and things to come. In reference to theſe Ways of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> God expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad his People to eat Blood; for ſo ſome of the <hi>Zabii</hi> did; and to meet with others who gathered it up into a Veſſel, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Blood ſhould be ſpilt on the ground like Water. And becauſe they ate their Sacrifice in a Circle round about the Blood, he alſo commanded that the Blood ſhould be ſprinkled (not about, but) upon the Altar.</q> Mr. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> in his <hi>Notes and Obſervations upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Paſſages of Scripture,</hi> Chap. 19. More Inſtances of the like ſort may be ſeen in

Where he writeth, that the Precept againſt Woollen and Linnen, was occaſioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Idolatrous Prieſts went ſo cloathed. That the <hi>Jews</hi> were forbidden to round the Corners of their Heads, becauſe it was the Cuſtom of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and others of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Prieſts to round them. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Idolaters threatened all Parents that their Children would never live unleſs they cauſed them to paſs through the Fire, was that ſtrict Prohibition of giving their children to <hi>Molech,</hi> which was by that cuſtom of paſſing through the Fire.

               <p n="1">1 SInce the ultimate End not only of Mans Creation, (<hi>Sect.</hi> 4.) but of his Redemption alſo, (<hi>Sect.</hi> 9.) is his own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Felicity, and that Felicity conſiſts in the perfect Love of <hi>God</hi> clearly ſeen, (<hi>Sect.</hi> 4.) 'tis evidently conſequent, that neither Faith, nor Hope, nor the moral Virtues, nor any Duty, nor Ordinance, nor Inſtitution whatſoever is at all available to everlaſting Bliſs, ſave only as in ſome kind or other they contribute to Charity, either in helping to procure it, to preſerve it, to augment it, or to compleat it; provided Charity begun here in this world, and that which is Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the next, differ not in nature, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in degree.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And that Felicity is the ſame Charity perfected in the other World, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in this, is manifeſt both from Reaſon
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40186:100"/> and Scripture. For ſince the Love of <hi>God</hi> apprehended by Faith, and the Love of <hi>God</hi> proceeding from Viſion, have both of them <hi>God,</hi> as he is the ſole Sovereign Good of the Soul, for their only Object, they are of the very ſame Nature, each of them being a Complacency or Delight taken in <hi>God</hi> under the ſelf ſame Notion, to wit, as he is the Supream Good of Man; ſo that albeit the Love which proceeds from Viſion, by reaſon of the clearer knowledg it affords of <hi>God,</hi> muſt needs be greater then the Love which comes by Faith, yet their difference is not in eſſence, but in degree only. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth Reaſon give Teſtimony to the Truth thereof alone, but Scripture alſo, which expreſly tells us, that <hi>Charity never faileth, 1. Cor.</hi> 13. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. If the Love of <hi>God</hi> in this and in the World to come be both of them Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, how comes Charity here to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a Theological Virtue together with Faith and Hope, which are only Means and Furtherers of Bliſs, and Charity hereafter Bliſs it ſelf?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> The reaſon is becauſe Charity here doth not always proceed to, and neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly end in, Charity hereafter, and therefore is looked upon as an Help to Felicity, rather
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40186:101"/> than any degree thereof, though in verity it be, in all thoſe who finally loſe it not, but depart hence habitually endued therewith, Felicity really begun in them, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated and perfected in Heaven, (<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragr.</hi> 2.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Faith</hi> is the firſt in order of the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Virtues, becauſe the Foundation of the Chriſtian Religion <hi>quoad nos,</hi> whilſt by it we are aſcertained of the whole Myſtery of the Goſpel of Chriſt. For what is Faith in general, but Knowledge grounded on Teſtimony, to which an aſſent is given? And what Chriſtian Faith in particular, but the Belief of Chriſt's Doctrine upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Divine Word relating or teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the ſame unto us? Hence it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be, that whoſoever believes the Holy Scripture, will believe the Incarnation, Life, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Judgment of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and that either ſuperficially and careleſly, or cordially and concernedly; if the former, he does it not to that intent, the Belief of them was propoſed by <hi>God,</hi> and ſo no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if he be not bettered by it; but if the latter, his Belief will be apt to work an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable Love in him towards the Author and Offerer of ſuch tranſcendent Kindneſs
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40186:101"/> as in the Goſpel is held forth; and therefore the more firm and frequent acts of Faith he exerciſes, the more will his Love to <hi>God</hi> be excited, till at length (if his Faith continue operative) it grows into an Habit, by which he is put into a State of Salvation, or the direct Way to everlaſting Bliſs, (<hi>Sect.</hi> 11.) Nor is this the whole benefit of an active Faith; for when Charity is thus by its means wrought in the Soul, Faith doth not ſtraight give over its Function, and begin to be idle, but grows more vigorous and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whilſt the Soul being enflamed with the Love of <hi>God,</hi> ſets it a freſh on work about the Object, the Motives, and other Helps of Bliſs, whence Charity becomes not only confirmed and ſtrengthened, but augmented alſo. For although it have frequent need of the Exerciſe of Faith, only to maintain and preſerve its Habit that it be not loſt, by reaſon of the many Temptations alway rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to enſnare the Affections of the Soul; yet in regard the more that Faith is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about the Object and Means of Bliſs, it will from thence be obvious to the Intellect to diſcover ſtill farther Excellencies in <hi>God,</hi> and greater Love and Kindneſs in him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards wretched Man, it cannot churſe, but that freſh Repreſentations of Lovelineſs in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40186:102"/> 
                  <hi>God</hi> being often made, the Soul will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more vigorouſly affected towards <hi>God,</hi> eſpecially when Charity is in good plight, having no preſent Adverſary or Temptation to encounter with.</p>
               <p n="4">4. After Faith, <hi>Hope</hi> lifts up its Head, and 'tis twofold, either ſuch as precedes Charity, or is ſubſequent to it, (even as we have ſeen Faith to be <hi>Paragr.</hi> 3.) The Hope which precedes Charity is ſubſervient to Faith, in aſſiſting it to beget the Love of <hi>God</hi> in the Soul, in manner here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; When Faith has begot ſome imperfect deſires of Bliſs, before Charity be habitually ſeated in the Soul, ſome ſlender hope will ariſe from the glowings, whereby the Soul perceives herſelf to grow warm in Affection towards God, that he will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to perfect the good Work he has already begun in her. This Hope, tho weak, contributes ſomething to Charity, if not choaked by freſh Sin; for while the Soul hopes for what ſhe deſires, her deſires of what ſhe hopes for is quickned thereby. Nevertheleſs till an habitual Love to <hi>God</hi> above all things, or Charity be throughly framed in the Soul, there's no Spiritual Life therein, but only previous diſpoſitions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for it. Such Hope is therefore by
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40186:102"/> the Schools termed <hi>informis;</hi> and the other Hope which follows Charity is called <hi>formata,</hi> becauſe Charity gives Live and Vigor to it, for no man has a firm well grounded Hope that he ſhall ever inherit Bliſs, till he find within himſelf that he has an hearty unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Love to God, and really perſues the known Means appointed by him to procure a full Fruition of him. Thus is Charity the Parent of a true and lively Hope, and to this intent that ſhe may be a Stay and Comfort to her Mother, for while men rationally hope to enjoy what they love, they are che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, confirmed, and ſtrengthened there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in their Love, becauſe they have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ariſing from a well-grounded Hope, that their Love is not in vain. Wherefore the greater our Charity is till perfect, that it excludes Hope through poſſeſſion of the thing hoped for, the ſtronger will our Hope be, and the ſtronger our Hope is, the greater Encouragement will be given to Charity, which perfected, is Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. The Love of God in Heaven may be an adhering with delight to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Felicity; or a Complacency, Joy and Satisfaction ariſing from the Beatific Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or Contemplation of the Divine Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40186:103"/> But the Love of <hi>God</hi> upon Earth ſeems rather to be a Deſire only to enjoy him eternally, than any the leaſt real par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of Bliſs, or the Enjoyment of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> Every true hearted ſincere Deſire to enjoy <hi>God</hi> eternally is an Effort and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous ſtriving of the Soul to be throughly ſatisfied with the full fruition of him for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; which ſince it is cauſed by the Delight it finds in the ſolid and devout Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Meditation of the Divine Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or of <hi>Gods</hi> wonderful gracious Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to man apprehended by Faith, or of both; the greater inward Joy and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Contentment men have in thinking of <hi>Gods</hi> tranſcendent Excellency, and of his ſtupendious Kindneſs ſhown to Man, the ſtronger will their Deſires grow to obtain a full Poſſeſſion of him to Eternity; whence it appears that the Deſire to enjoy God is an effect of Charity, or Delight taken in him, and not Charity it ſelf; but is a very great Advancer of it, in that it puts men upon the exerciſe of all things which are known to be available to the Fruition of <hi>God;</hi> and indeed is ſo like to Charity, that it is not without a near Inſpection diſcerna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from it; yet certainly is diſtinct from
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40186:103"/> it, as may be farther gathered from the conſtant anſwer we uſe to give to one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of us, why we ſo earneſtly deſire this or that thing, which is, becauſe we have a great Love for it, or take much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it; but do not ever ſay, we love a thing, or are delighted with it, becauſe we deſire it. In fine, then I take it to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>Charitas viae,</hi> and <hi>Charitas patriae,</hi> the Love of <hi>God</hi> here and hereafter, differ only, as the leſs, and more perfect, whence I conceive, aroſe that common Saying of Divines, <hi>Gratia eſt ſemen Gloriae,</hi> and the occaſion of calling aſwell <hi>Grace</hi> as <hi>Glory</hi> the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> in Scripture.</p>

               <p n="1">1. HAving ſhown after what manner the Theological Virtues Faith and Hope are uſeful and ſerviceable unto Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it follows to be conſidered of, how the moral Virtues, <hi>Prudence, Justice, Fortitude</hi> and <hi>Temperance</hi> miniſter help thereunto; in reſpect of which alone, they are truly Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and not otherways. For ſince Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here and hereafter is Felicity, the one begun, the other perfected, (<hi>Sect.</hi> 13.) and that Felicity is the ultimate End of Man; (<hi>Sect.</hi> 4.) it certainly follows, that not any thing at all is virtuous, or good to man as man, or a Rational Creature made to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit Bliſs, but what is in ſome reſpect or other advantagious and beneficial to Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo that although he be commonly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd a <hi>Prudent</hi> Man, who diſcreetly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40186:104"/> his actions to ſome honeſt end propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; a <hi>juſt</hi> man whoſe care it is to do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly in the Affairs of the World; a <hi>ſtout</hi> man who behaves himſelf couragiouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Countries Foes; a <hi>temperate</hi> man who regularly moderates his Appetite about Meat and Drink; yet is not any of theſe truly virtuous by ſo doing, except he do it out of Love to that End whereunto all his Actions ought either mediately or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to tend, becauſe in the obtaining of that alone, Humane Nature is perfected, the Man made happy; whereas other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Ends beneficial in their kind to ſome particular purpoſes may be attained, and yet everlaſting Miſery not be prevented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. This then being apparent, that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is the Scope and Aim which the moral Virtues ought to look and level at, let's ſee in what way they compaſs their deſigned End.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Prudence,</hi> (which becauſe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant <hi>circa agibilia</hi> is reckoned with the moral Virtues) is the practical Knowledg of things to be deſired, or ſhunned, in reſpect of ſome honeſt end ſought after; whence it is manifeſt that Prudence is deeply engaged in every moral Virtue, and therefore how much ſoever Charity is advanced by any of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40186:105"/> them, Prudence always plays its part in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing thereunto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Juſtice</hi> is ſaid to be a Virtue whereby we give to every one what is due or right for them to have; the Diſcourſe whereof I'le therefore omit till I come to the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> or <hi>Moral Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Fortitude</hi> is that Virtue which ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Soul to overcome Difficulties that would avert the Will from the Proſecution of Good, for fear of Evil to be encountred with before the Good can be obtained. 'Tis apparent therefore to ſee, that, conſidering a Chriſtians Life is a continual Warfare, where daily Enemies that would hinder Mans Love to God above all things, are ſtoutly to be combated, if Victory be deſired and expected, Fortitude is a Virtue primely uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto Charity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Temperance</hi> is a Virtue which regulates the deſires of the Will about the Objects of Taſt and Touch, as Meat, Drink, and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, and is hugely ſerviceable to Charity. For whereas the Will through the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mans vitiated Nature is prone to follow the Guſt of the ſenſitive Appetite in the immoderate perſuit of whatſoever is grateful to it, and is apt thereby to be drawn from the Love of its chief Object the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40186:105"/> Good, which is God; Temperance, by reſtraining the ſenſitive Appetite from exceſs in its deſire of Meat and Drink, doth thereby reduce the animal Spirits to a more moderate Quantity and Temper, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe through their too great abundance and activeneſs are wont to excite the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty to a violent luſting after all ſuch things as are pleaſing to it; and that again diſturbs and blunders the Rational Powers of the Soul, and by eagerly preſſing upon them, averts the Underſtanding from the due Conſideration of things, and thence totally gains the Phantaſie, and thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnares and captivates the Will. Beſides, Temperance is very ſerviceable, <hi>ut Cauſa re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movens prohibens,</hi> to Prayer and Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the two faithful Enſurers (as I may well call them) of Charity, for they never fail to enſure it to us (as will be made appear in the next Section) if we fail not to make ſure of employing them in their Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. By what hath been ſaid of the moral Virtues, if true, they are not <hi>bona per ſe, good in themſelves,</hi> which is contrary to the Opinion of moſt men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> Whatſoever is <hi>bonum per ſe, good in it ſelf,</hi> is of it ſelf the Object of Deſire, and ſo having no Reference, as ſuch, to any

The former the moral Virtues are not, otherwiſe God would be totally excluded from being in any ſort Man's ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate End and Sovereign Good.

Juſtice indeed ſeems to be eternally neceſſary, in that we muſt give for ever to God, Angels and Men what is their due; but Charity abundantly ſupplies that, foraſmuch as to love every one of them, as they ought to be beloved, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently

For he that acts virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, acts rationally, and he that acts rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40186:107"/> acts for a good End, which muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be Mans ultimate End, or elſe ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate End conducible to the obtaining of it, becauſe Mans ultimate End alone is deſirable for its own Cauſe, and other things only as they are in order to it, as was prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, (<hi>Par.</hi> 1.) and in the <hi>Solut.</hi> of the <hi>firſt Object.</hi> in this <hi>Section.</hi> Such a Man indeed as is ſaid in the Objection I am now anſwering to be a moral honeſt man (if there were any ſuch) would be leſs miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by what he did; but ſo will every one be accordingly as he is leſs vitious (<hi>Sect.</hi> 7.) although he be not in any ſort truly Virtuous. Is there then you'l reply no ſuch thing as <hi>meer moral Virtue</hi> or <hi>Honeſty?</hi> I anſwer yes. <hi>Meer moral Virtue</hi> or <hi>Honeſty</hi> is, when a man without the Direction or Help of any other Law, ſave only of the Law of Nature, doth from the Conſideration of Gods tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Excellency in himſelf, of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the World, and eſpecially of Man, (all demonſtrable by Reaſon, as is to be ſeen by the <hi>firſt, third</hi> and <hi>fourth Section</hi>) and from the Beauty, Order and Preſervation of the Univerſe (manifeſt to ſenſe) raiſe his Thoughts from poring on Earthly things, to the Contemplation of the Divine Majeſty and Goodneſs; and by frequent admiring
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40186:107"/> and adoring him, together with giving Praiſe and Thanks unto him for all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of this Life, acquires an habitual Love of him, and thence deſires to be fully ſatisfied with the knowledge of him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing all terreſtrial Pleaſures in compariſon of the ſame; and in virtue of his Love to God, doth heartily wiſh to all Mankind the like Happineſs he wiſheth to himſelf, as knowing that things of the ſame Kind tend by Nature to the ſame End. This I take to be <hi>pure Moral Vertue</hi> or <hi>Honeſty,</hi> with which if any man depart hence, he will at length through <hi>Chriſt</hi> be eternally happy (<hi>ſect. 12. par.</hi> 3, 4.) But ſo great is the Corruption of Man's Nature through <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Sin, (<hi>ſect.</hi> 9.) that <hi>ſuch Virtue</hi> or <hi>Honeſty</hi> is attainable by very few.</p>

If the moral Virtues be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not good in themſelves, by reaſon they have a tendency to a farther good to be obtained by them, 'twill follow, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that has a tendency to a farther good to be obtained by it, is good in it ſelf; which is very unlikely to be true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> When we ſpeak of moral goodneſs we evermore intend ſomething by it, which is perfective of man's Rational Nature; ſo that to enquire, whether the moral Virtues
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40186:108"/> be good in themſelves, or not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the ſame as to ask, whether they be directly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately perfective of man's Rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yea or no; or be only uſeful to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſomething which is directly and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately perfective of it. This latter I take to be true, not the former; and my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe the moral Virtues, in that they are not any laſting permanent good of the Soul, but paſs away and leave it when it becomes poſſeſſed of its everlaſting good, Felicity, (<hi>Solut.</hi> of <hi>Obj.</hi> 1.) are inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, or ſo far only good unto it, as they are neceſſarily helps and means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that good which is the eternally-during Perfection of it, whence it ſeems plain that the Benefit of the moral Virtues, and ſo likewiſe of all Gifts, Graces and Ordinances, (as Faith, Hope, Prayer, the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which ceaſe upon the full enjoyment of God, conſiſts in their very <hi>Tendency</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the good to be obtained by them. But yet if any will be ſo ſcrupulouſly nice as to demand, Whether that which is <hi>neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> good and uſeful in its <hi>very Nature,</hi> though but <hi>inſtrumentally,</hi> to the perfecting of Man, be not <hi>good in it ſelf,</hi> I ſhall not contend, but yield it is, provided it will be granted me again, that it is <hi>inſtrumentally</hi>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:40186:108"/> ſo, and <hi>no more;</hi> for then in conſequence thereto, it muſt of neceſſity be owned, that it is not deſirable for its own ſake, but for the ſake of that which it is an inſtrumental Cauſe to procure. In this ſenſe I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> are good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as without which <hi>Charity</hi> cannot be acquired; (<hi>ſect. 11. par.</hi> 2, 3, 4.) and the <hi>moral Virtues</hi> alſo in <hi>this Section, par.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5. are made out to be no leſs; and ſo ſhall <hi>Prayer</hi> likewiſe be manifeſted in the <hi>next Section,</hi> to be good in it ſelf, or in its own Nature <hi>neceſſarily uſeful,</hi> for acquiring Man's Chief Good, in the everlaſting Fruition of which his Rational Being will be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

               <p n="1">1. SEeing nothing is good to man as man, but what either ultimately compleats and perfects him, as ſuch; or ſomething that hath a tendency, and is ſerviceable thereto (<hi>ſect.</hi> 14.) 'tis evident, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ought to be deſired of God which may prove any the leaſt hindrance to man's ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate End.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard therefore Eternal Felicity, or the perfect love of God is man's ultimate End and Perfection (<hi>ſect. 4. par.</hi> 12, 13.) 'tis apparent that nothing which will obſtruct the Love of God, ought to be prayed for.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And foraſmuch as neither <hi>Health,</hi> nor <hi>Wealth,</hi> nor <hi>temporal Honour,</hi> nor even the <hi>Saving of Life,</hi> but may in ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances prove <hi>prejudicial</hi> to <hi>Charity,</hi> none of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40186:109"/> all theſe are <hi>abſolutely</hi> to be prayed for, but <hi>conditionally</hi> only, and ſo far forth as they may be <hi>uſeful</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It remains therefore that nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Charity</hi> it ſelf, and what always fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers it, are <hi>abſolutely</hi> to be begged of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wherefore ſince <hi>Virtue</hi> (whether The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ological or Moral) is a thing which <hi>always</hi> furthers <hi>Charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (ſect.</hi> 11, 13, &amp; 14.) 'tis clear that <hi>Virtue</hi> is always to be <hi>abſolutely</hi> prayed for.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And foraſmuch as God, who is Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf, grudges no man that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally good for him; but ever grants him his deſire, if <hi>he ask not amiſs,</hi> Jam. 4. 3. 'tis plain that <hi>Prayer</hi> always obtains <hi>Virtue</hi> of God, whenſoever it is made aright; which is then done, when it is <hi>unfeigned, fervent</hi> and <hi>frequent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. For ſince the Almighty does not by the ſole force of his omnipotent Will, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confer his gracious Gifts on Man, except on ſome extraordinary Occaſions, when ordinary Means are inſufficient for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned End (otherwiſe he ſhould be in a ſtill continued courſe of working Miracles) but conveys them to us by ſecond Cauſes; if it be ſo that <hi>unfeigned, fervent</hi> and <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40186:110"/> Prayer</hi> be an effectual Means whereby he conveys unto us the <hi>Theological</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Virtues,</hi> then doth unfeigned, fervent and frequent Prayer always obtain them of God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And that <hi>ſuch Prayer</hi> is an effectual Means (or which never fails) of conveying all the Virtues to us, will be made appear, by ſhewing the efficacious power it has to procure each of them in particular.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For firſt, He that from an unfeigned heart pours forth fervent and frequent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God, that he may live temperately, cannot while he doth ſo live intemperately; but on the contrary, will endeavour by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Acts of Temperance, after a conſtant temperate courſe of Life, and by frequent Acts are Habits, or a facility of acting, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And whoſo beggeth of God in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and fervency of Devotion the Grace to deal uprightly to all men, will, if he be conſtant likewiſe in his Requeſt, abhor the injuring or doing wrong to any one, and by often excerciſing Acts of Juſtice, he will certainly obtain the habit thereof.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Neither will he, who unfeignedly, ardently and conſtantly prays that he may overcome all ſuch difficulties as would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40186:110"/> his arriving at Bliſs, for fear of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Evils to be encountred with in purſuit thereof, forbear to ſet himſelf ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to oppoſe and repel Temptations, and to reject the Enticements of the World, which would draw him from the Love of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God and ſupream Good to the vain and tranſitory Delights of it ſelf, and ſo by frequent doing thereof, he'l contract an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in overcoming what would eternally deſtroy his Soul, if yielded to.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And foraſmuch as he that is conſtant in ſincere and fervent Prayer for the Grace of Faith, will undoubtedly give himſelf to read with diligence and devotion the holy Scripture, to frequent the hearing of the Word preached, and to meditate often on the Contents of Sacred Writ; how can it otherwiſe be, but that he ſhould by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acquire a firm and ſtedfaſt pious Belief of Divine Truths revealed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And in regard that he, whoſe Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God is unfeigned and ardent, and withal frequently uſed for obtaining of Hope, and putting his Truſt and Confidence in God, that he will be graciouſly pleaſed to excite his Deſires, and proſper his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for the attainment of Bliſs, will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40186:111"/> be induced thereby to refrain from thoſe things which he knows muſt deſtroy all hope of Salvation; and to addict himſelf to a ſtricter Courſe of Life than he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly led; and ſo by the daily Uſe and Exerciſe of ſuch Ways and Means as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to Felicity, he'l increaſe his Hope, till it grow by degrees into an Habit.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And as for Charity, whoſoever hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily and with earneſtneſs and conſtancy of Deſire to attain to the Love of God above all things, makes his humble addreſs to the Heavenly Throne for the ſame; it cannot otherwiſe fall out, but that he muſt often be put upon the ſerious conſideration of the unmerited great Love of God to Man in creating, preſerving and redeeming him; of the tranſcendent value of the immenſe and endleſs Joys of Heaven; and of the Vanity of the ſhort and tranſitory Pleaſures of this World, which, if purſued, will bring him to intolerable and perpetual Miſery; whence he'l learn to deſpiſe all ſublunary fading Delights in compariſon of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting enjoyment of his moſt gracious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, Suſtainer and Saviour; the greater and greater deſire of which in his Heart, cannot chuſe but grow by an ardent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in Prayer for the ſame, till Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40186:111"/> be habitually ſeated in the Soul.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Thus we ſee that Prayer, if it be ſuch as God commands, doth certainly, as a ſubordinate Cauſe under himſelf, who is the principal Author of all good whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, always prove an effectual Means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling every Virtue both Theological and Moral into the Soul of Man; ſo that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Virtues not here particularly treated of, as Humility, Patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually got by fervent and frequent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proceeding from a ſincere affection and deſire of them, as thoſe which have been handled, be. Yea, and temporal Bleſſings both for our ſelves and others, are alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of God by devout Prayer, when the Divine Wiſdom ſees the beſtowing of them will be a Means to improve in Godlineſs (for the Prayers ſake) the Souls of thoſe for whom the Prayer is made.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And if Prayer rightly made, be ſo potent and prevalent to procure the Habits of Virtue, as we have ſeen it is; how much more eaſily will it preſerve them being once obtained, ſince every time we ſeriouſly pray, after the Soul is poſſeſſed with the habitual Love of God, we are exerciſing and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating Faith, Hope and Charity, whilſt he that loves God above all things, firmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40186:112"/> that the grand and main Deſign of his whole Life ſhall be a continued Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy through God's gracious Aſſiſtance, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the perpetual Fruition of him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſo that whenever he makes his pious Addreſſes to God in Prayer, they are always performed in Faith or a ſtedfaſt Belief of the Truth and faithful Performance of all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Revelations and Promiſes; and in an aſſured Hope and Confidence in the Mercy and Goodneſs of God towards him, from the unfeigned Love he finds he has to God; ſo that the more a pious man pray, the more he exerciſes the Graces of Faith, Hope and Charity, whence their Habits muſt needs be confirmed and ſtrengthened accordingly.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The like is alſo true of the Moral Virtues, whoſe Habits are corroborated and more firmly fixed by the devout Prayers of a godly perſon; for the better one is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Faith, Hope and Charity, the greater Vigilancy and Diligence will he uſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and keep under by Temperance his carnal appetite; to do right by Juſtice to every one; and to ſtrive through Fortitude againſt all ſinful Temptations; and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of thoſe Virtues cannot fail to invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and fortifie them proportionably to the meaſure thereof.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Why may not, you'l ſay, the <hi>meer Conſideration</hi> of the neceſſity of Virtue for the obtaining of Bliſ, put men upon the practice of all ſuch things as are apt either to procure it, or to keep it when it is procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? And if it may, what peculiar Excellency or benefit is there in devout Prayer?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> That the <hi>ſole Conſideration,</hi> if ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and frequent, of the neceſſity of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in order to Felicity, will excite men to deſire and ſeek after it, and if already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, to preſerve it, there's no doubt to be made. But nevertheleſs there is a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit peculiar to Prayer above and beyond the Utility of ſuch Conſideration, For, <hi>First,</hi> in applying our ſelves to God, who is our ſole ſupream Good, we fix our Thoughts more ſteadily on the Means availa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the gaining thereof, when we ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beg them of him to that end; yea, and the <hi>very Conſideration</hi> of the Neceſſity of Virtue will it ſelf be much improved and heightned thereby. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whenever we devoutly pray, we comport our ſelves with great reverence and Humility, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne of God, which rendring the Action of Prayer ſerious and ſacred, makes it to work a deeper impreſſion of the Virtue prayed for in our Thoughts, than
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40186:113"/> the bare conſideration of the Virtue without ſuch Prayer would do. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When with earneſtneſs of Deſire we petition our heavenly Father to grant us his merciful Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance for the obtaining any Virtue, we on our parts plainly engage our ſelves thereby to him, to employ our own Care and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours towards the acquiring thereof, which muſt needs cauſe a ſtronger inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Soul, and a more ſedulous dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in our Actions to obtain the Virtue pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned for, than the <hi>ſole Conſideration</hi> of the Benefit thereof towards Bliſs, could poſſibly do. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There is nothing more quickens the Deſire, and encourages the Endeavours after any thing we highly value, than a well grounded Hope to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it by the Means uſed to obtain it by; and we have his Promiſes who is no leſs <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> than <hi>able</hi> to perform, that if we ask not amiſs (as we never do when we pray for Virtue with Sincerity, Fervency and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of Mind, as is clear by what has been ſaid in <hi>this Section</hi>) we ſhall moſt certainly have our Requeſt.</p>

If Sincerity, Fervency and Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of Prayer be neceſſary for the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Virtue, it is but rarely, I fear, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd unto; for although many pray fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40186:113"/> and with a real deſire of what they pray for, yet are there but few that do it with much earneſtneſs or fervency of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> There are ſeveral degrees of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency or Earneſtneſs, the loweſt of all which (and Sincerity of Affection always implies ſome degree thereof) if it be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with frequency of Prayer iſſuing from an affectionate Heart, will in a longer continuance of time effect as much as an higher degree thereof in a ſhorter; ſo that all devout Prayer conſtantly kept to, will at length, though ſome ſooner than other, procure the Habit of Virtue prayed for.</p>

Very few are ſo intent in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er but that their Minds are often diſtracted and turned away from their due Object to thoughts of Vanity, and how then ſhould Prayer be of that efficacy as either to beget in ſuch an Habit of Virtue, or to preſerve and ſtrengthen it if it be obtain'd?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> He that, when he goes to pray, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly deſires and really ſtrives to pray without diſtraction, and yet finds his Mind carried away to Objects not intended, will certainly be troubled in Spirit thereat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ſhews that that diſtraction is againſt his Will, and cauſed by the agitation of the

So that ſuch diſtraction as is here mentioned, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary, and nothing that is involuntary is ſinful. But to take away all ſcruple that it is involuntary, let him that is diſtracted in Prayer, repeat over ſuch paſſages, at leaſt, where his Thoughts wandered, (which in private Devotion any one may well do) till he mind their Senſe, and then he may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured his preceding diſtraction will prove no prejudice to the prevalent effectualneſs of his Prayer.</p>

Forgiveneſs of Sin is a thing neceſſary to Salvation, but what abſolute certainty is there, that every one that begs the pardon of it, how unfeignedly, fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conſtantly ſoever he doth it, ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain remiſſion thereof, when it is wholly in God's power and pleaſure whether he will pardon the ſame or no?</p>

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40186:114"/> of him before the enjoyment of worldly pleaſures, Mortal Sin is expelled out of the Soul, and taken away, and conſequently the penalty thereof eternal Damnation is quitted and voided, the forſaking of Sin and the pardon of Sin going always of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity together (<hi>ſect. 11. par.</hi> 6, 7, 8.) Whence it is manifeſt, that, ſince he who in ſincerity of heart craves pardon of his Sins, and ſtrives in Prayer to God with fervency and conſtancy of Devotion for the ſame, will, continuing ſo to do, abhor his former Tranſgreſſions, and leaving off his ſinful manner of Life, turn by true Repentance unto God, and take delight in him as his ſole ſupream Good; it is manifeſt, I ſay, that unfeigned, fervent and frequent Prayer doth evermore obtain Remiſſion of Sin. Nor doth this at all gainſay that abſolute Verity, that God only forgiveth Sin, ſeeing he alone both inſtituted the Means which take away Sin, and gives them alſo Virtue to do it. But to think that God ever with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds his Mercy and Kindneſs, when men are immediately diſpoſed by due preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to receive them, is a groſs Opinion vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Nature of God, who is eſſential Goodneſs, and repugnant to plain Scripture, which aſſureth us, that <hi>when the wicked man
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40186:115"/> turneth away from his wickedneſs that he hath committed, and doth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave his Soul alive,</hi> Ezek. 18. 27. Yea, we have <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf verifying, and ſweetly inſinuating unto us from his own ſacred Mouth, how ready God is to embrace men returning to him, by the comfortable <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Prodigal Son,</hi> whom repenting of his riotous wicked living, the Father received with as free and kind an heart, as if he had never in the leaſt gone aſtray, nor once done amiſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. But nevertheleſs it is very dangerous to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the uſe of Means which lead to Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance (even omitting the Conſideration of the hazard of ſudden Death, and that Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, the longer they continue, ſtick the cloſer) not only, becauſe without that there is no Repentance unleſs miraculouſly wrought (which it is great impiety to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume upon) but alſo becauſe when men lie ſick and in pain, their Affliction, though it may cauſe remorſe for Sin will not (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be ſmart and pungent) permit them to exerciſe Prayer as it ought to be, and conſequently the habit of Charity not got thereby, they will die in their Sins.</p>

By the account that has been given of Prayer, it ſhould ſeem to be a vain thing to pray for <hi>others,</hi> becauſe our Prayers for them work not on their Affections, as they are apt to do on our own; and yet it is a Duty injoyned us to pray for a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as well as for our ſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> Although we do not always profit others in praying for them; yet we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly benefit our ſelves in the hearty doing of it; for whilſt we earneſtly deſire their ſpiritual or eternal Good (the only things to be abſolutely prayed for, <hi>Par.</hi> 4.) we cannot chuſe but be affected thereby to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that which we wiſh for them. And therefore the Commandment given to pray for our Neighbour, is not in vain, albeit our Prayers ſhould do him no good. For if every man in the World ſhould often and cordially pray for every other man, as he ought to do, every one alive would have benefit in praying for his Neighbour, by aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting his own Love both to God and Man thereby. But beſides, the Prayers of the Faithful do alway profit their Neighbour in due Circumſtances, for in caſe he be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly penitent, and earneſtly crave the Prayers of ſome holy Perſon, or of the Church, the Prayers offered to God for him, will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40186:116"/> do him good, whilſt his Opinion of their Piety, and conſequently of their Favour with God, will encourage his Truſt and Confidence in God's Mercy for their Prayers ſake, and thence elevate his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God; for the hope of Mercy and Kindneſs from God, and Affection to God, go ſtill hand in hand, and mutually of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity ſtrengthen each other. Yea, though there be no Requeſt made by the party pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, the Prayers of the Godly, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with very great ardency &amp; conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Devotion (as the Prayers of the pious Mother <hi>Monica</hi> for her Son <hi>Augustine</hi> were) will undoubtedly obtain their deſired event, becauſe, in that they are for certain the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the ſpecial Grace of God, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail of an happy iſſue, leſt otherwiſe God's own Work continued in, ſhould not have the event, which it deſignedly by the Divine Favour tended to.</p>

                  <hi>Object. 6. Miracles</hi> have been obtained by Prayer, which, becauſe they interrupt the Courſe of natural Cauſes inſtituted by God, ſeems to import a Change in God's Mind (which has been ſaid to be immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) or however, that the influence ſuch Prayer had, was wholly upon God, and not at all upon Man.</p>

                  <hi>Solut.</hi> That God is immutable, has been proved, (<hi>Sect. 1.

And in regard nothing is truly good and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to them but <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and the Fruit thereof, <hi>everlaſting Life (Sect.</hi> 14.) the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of working <hi>Miracles,</hi> is to cauſe <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in their hearts in order to the bringing them to <hi>Eternal Bliſs.</hi> And foraſmuch as <hi>Holineſs</hi> is not wrought in the heart but by <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Motives (Sect. 9. par. 4.) Miracles</hi> are intended for the confirmation of the Truth of ſome Doctrin requiſite for directing the Underſtanding, or for afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Motives to incline the Will to Virtue, or for both, at ſuch certain times, and on ſuch occaſions when the conſtant courſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and uſual Series of Cauſes appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God to draw Men from the Love of worldly Vanities and ſinful Luſts, to the

For as to the former ſort, neither the ordinary nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary workings of God (unleſs in a juncture perhaps of ſome preſſing Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) uſe to work a Reformation in them, as is apparent by the Examples of <hi>Korah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> oppoſing and reviling <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and of thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> who heard Chriſt's Doctrin, ſaw his holy Life, and beheld his Miracles of Wonder and Mercy, and yet would not receive him, but barbarouſly and ungratefully proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to Death. As <hi>Miracles</hi> we have ſeen are done for the benefit of Men; ſo was it likewiſe out of deſign for their good, that the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them to be done at the <hi>Instance</hi> of ſome or other <hi>holy Perſon,</hi> or with <hi>reference to him.</hi> For that Men, whoſe <hi>holy Lives</hi> were known and obſerved by the People, ſhould be concerned about the working of <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> was requiſite on this account, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice might be taken of the great and ſpecial regard the Almighty had to <hi>Holineſs,</hi> which otherwiſe they would not have underſtood,

                  <hi>Object</hi> 7. There is nothing ſaid in all this Diſcourſe of Prayer, or the other mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed means of Beatitude, of the Power of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> without which, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all other Helps, are not able to work a through Amendment of Life to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> It is readily granted, that without the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> all Helps and Means whatſoever are ineffectual to the obtaining of Felicity; but in the <hi>right uſe</hi> of the <hi>Means,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is evermore ſuppoſed to be preſent. For ſince <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Aſcenſion into Heaven, all the Aids and means of Salvation are ordered and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> whom he promiſed to ſend after his departure to abide with the Church. But to aſſert that all the <hi>Means</hi> which <hi>God the Father</hi> appointed, <hi>God the Son</hi> prepared, and <hi>God the Holy Ghoſt</hi> makes application of to particular perſons, ſhould
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40186:118"/> really work nothing, would be too abſurd to ſuppoſe any rational Perſon guilty of. For in caſe they work or effect nothing, to what purpoſe is their uſe? or wherefore did Chriſt undergo what he did, both in Life and Death, to prepare them, and cauſe his Diſciples alſo to publiſh them to the daily hazard, and at length, the loſs of Life? But if any thing be effected by them, in what is their effective Virtue terminated? Do they not reach the Underſtanding to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince it, nor the Will to incline it? if not, whence is Man's Converſion wrought? If you ſay, that the Spirit of God comes after the Means uſed, and cauſes by his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate operation the Converſion made in the Soul, you attribute that to God, which cannot be truly affirmed of him; for ſince he is a <hi>pure eſſential Act,</hi> and that <hi>whatever is in God</hi> is <hi>God (Sect. 1. Par.</hi> 9. and 11.) it is not poſſible that he ſhould effect any thing ſave only by willing it, without any phyſical action, operation, or emanation iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him, and terminated in the Object, whether the effect be to be brought about with or without means; for if it be to be brought about without means, it unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follows from <hi>God's ſole willing</hi> of it (as the <hi>Creation</hi> did) there being no need nor
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:40186:118"/> uſe of any thing beſides to produce it. But if <hi>Means</hi> be appointed by God to be uſed, then will not the effect follow without the <hi>uſe</hi> of the <hi>Means</hi> appointed, they <hi>immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> yet but <hi>inſtrumentally,</hi> producing it, by virtue of the <hi>principal Cauſe</hi> which employs and invigorates them to that End, or <hi>wills that the Effect ſhould be brought to paſs by them.</hi> If it be urged that <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf ſaith, <hi>None can come unto me unleſs the Father, which hath ſent me, draw him,</hi> John 6. 44. I anſwer, by granting the infallible truth thereof, but withal deny, that it can be gathered from thence, that whom the Father draws, he draws them not by <hi>Means,</hi> there being no mention made of the <hi>Manner</hi> of his draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Yea, is it not plain, that the <hi>Father</hi> drew men to <hi>Chriſt</hi> by means of a <hi>Voice from Heaven,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him? Matth.</hi> 17. 5. And what were the <hi>Works,</hi> but <hi>Means</hi> to draw men to believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which he ſpeaks of to the <hi>Jews?</hi> ſaying, <hi>If I do not the Works of my Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me not; but if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the Works,</hi> John 10. 37, 38. In a word, ſince <hi>God</hi> ſent his <hi>Son</hi> into the World, that whoſoever believed on him ſhould not periſh but have everlaſting Life,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:40186:119"/> it is manifeſt, that <hi>every thing</hi> our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour</hi> either <hi>taught, did,</hi> or <hi>ſuffered,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men are induced to believe and truſt in him for Salvation, is a <hi>Means</hi> by which the <hi>Father</hi> draws them unto <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> As a material Inſtrument cannot ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually work on matter not qualified to be wrought upon, (as for Inſtance, a Knife cannot cut Braſs or Iron aſunder, but a Straw or Stick it can) ſo the means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation held forth by the Goſpel (though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſiſted by the Spirit of God, they are as apt to convert, as a Knife being employed by the Hand, is to cut) cannot actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, but when they are applied to a Subject fitly prepared to take impreſſion from them; and therefore when they meet not with a due Diſpoſition, or right Preparation of Heart to receive them, Converſion will not enſue. And foraſmuch as ſuch Diſpoſition or Preparation of Heart is not in the Power of Mans <hi>Free Will,</hi> (as <hi>Pelagius</hi> impiouſly held it was) but is the undoubted work of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40186:119"/> God, every ones <hi>Converſion</hi> is truly attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in that he works the mentioned Diſpoſition in the Soul, by cauſing it to give due Attendance to the means of Salvation offered, as may be clearly collected from the Inſtance of <hi>Lydia's Converſion, whoſe Heart the Lord opened, that ſhe attended unto the things which were ſpoken of Paul,</hi> Acts 16. 14. For through that her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, the Word of God delivered by St. <hi>Paul</hi> took effect and converted her. There is then no Scruple at all to be made, but that every man's <hi>Converſion</hi> is the Work of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> in the heart, both in reſpect of the <hi>Application</hi> of the <hi>Means</hi> of Grace, and of giving due <hi>Attendance</hi> thereunto. The only difficulty lies in this, how the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> to the Doctrine of Salvation requiſite on Man's part to his <hi>Converſion</hi> is wrought, whether by ſome <hi>phyſical Influence</hi> or real E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manation iſſuing from God, and penetrating the Heart of Man, (as Fire warms by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth Heat into the thing warmed by it;) or by the <hi>ſole force</hi> of the <hi>Divine Will,</hi> without any ſuch, either Influence or any intermediate Cauſe whatſoever; or laſtly, that through the Almighties Government of the World in ordering <hi>ſecond Cauſes</hi> (which are all in his diſpoſing) man's mind becomes
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40186:120"/> inclined, to give due heed to Inſtruction and Exhortation, by <hi>Motives</hi> offered ſeveral ways (ſuch as are pain of Body, loſs of Eſtate or Friends, Plagues, Deſolation, ſudden and violent Deaths, great and unexpected Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Deliverances, with divers other things ſeen, heard, or read of.) The <hi>firſt</hi> of the three rehearſed ways the abſolute Perfection of the Divine Nature makes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; for how ſhould any <hi>Phyſical Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> or real Emanation proceed out of him, whoſe Being is <hi>Immutable,</hi> one <hi>eſſential Act,</hi> and <hi>entirely ſimple? (Sect. 1. Par.</hi> 8, 9, 10.) The <hi>ſecond Way</hi> would be as miraculous, as the creating of all things out of nothing; and the <hi>Attention</hi> given to the Means of Grace would be <hi>irreſiſtible</hi> in all Men. The <hi>third Way</hi> therefore I take to be truth, and am confirm'd therein from St. <hi>Paul's Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> (which, though ſtrange and unuſual, yet was it not effected by the immediate Will of God without all intermediate Means) from his becoming all things to all men, over and above his zealous preaching of Chriſt; and indeed from the conſtant manner and method of God's dealing with Mankind ſince the very Creation. If it be replied that I ſeem to place the ſole and whole immediate Cauſe of Man's Converſion
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:40186:120"/> in the <hi>Means,</hi> and only the remote Cauſe thereof in the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> which yet is held by <hi>Divines</hi> actually to reach and work by its <hi>immediate Inſpiration</hi> the Effect; I anſwer, that the <hi>Divine Will,</hi> which inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and orders the <hi>Means</hi> as well for Converſion, as for the Preparation of the Heart, goes ſtill along therewith to make them effectual; not unlike to a mans <hi>Mind,</hi> which after he hath made a Pen to write with, and prepared Ink and Paper, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually goes along with the Pen to effect the intended Writing; ſo that I plainly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what anſwers to that which others call the immediate Operation or Inſpiration of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or Divine Influx or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the Means of Grace, whilſt I hold that as the <hi>Pen</hi> cannot write without the continued aſſiſtance of the Hand moved by <hi>the Will,</hi> ſo neither can the Means of <hi>Grace</hi> convert a Sinner, or cauſe any other holy Act, without the <hi>perpetual Aid</hi> of the <hi>Divine Will</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling them thereunto. If it be ſaid, that albeit Man's <hi>Mind</hi> guide and go along with the <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Pen,</hi> yet the <hi>Pen alone</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately touches the Paper, and makes the Impreſſion in it; my Anſwer is, that both the <hi>Mind,</hi> and the <hi>vis impreſſa</hi> conveyed by
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40186:121"/> the Hand to <hi>the Pen,</hi> reach as far as the <hi>Pen it ſelf,</hi> otherwiſe the Pen could not write what it doth, either as to the <hi>Character,</hi> or the <hi>Matter,</hi> (for what knows it of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of any Figure or Subject whatſoever?) and even ſo doth the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> no leſs than the <hi>Means</hi> of Man's Salvation, reach the Heart, both to <hi>prepare</hi> it, and <hi>convert</hi> it unto God; but with this difference, that the Writing on the Paper is an Impreſſion neceſſarily received by it; but the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Diſpoſition and Converſion of the Heart, are Effects wrought therein, by a voluntary Compliance and Concurrence of the <hi>Will</hi> of Man with the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Grace.</hi>

                  <hi>Solut.</hi> That Bodily Exerciſe is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to Salvation, is plain from hence, that ſome are dumb and cannot ſpeak; ſome are not able through Infirmity to bow the Knee, or lift up their Hands; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers want their Sight, and have not Eyes wherewith to look up to Heaven, and yet all of them may be ſaved and go to Bliſs, and undoubtedly ſhall do ſo, if they be habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually poſſeſſed of Charity when they leave the World. But nevertheleſs this is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:40186:123"/> that Bodily Exerciſe is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or that it may be omitted by thoſe who are in a condition with convenience to perform it. For an earneſt and vehement expreſſion of words, an humbling our ſelves with reverence on our Knees, and the lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up our Hands and Eyes to Heaven, are all of them Helps to ſtir up inward Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make our Prayers, Praiſes and Thanks more fervent, and conſequently more effectual to promote Charity. Nor is the Muſick either of Voices or Inſtruments unuſeful for exciting Devotion, whilſt it is apt to put the animal Spirits into ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as will cauſe the Heart to be carried with delight towards the Object of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which men endeavour to honour and celebrate thereby.</p>

Although external Actions and Geſtures may improve internal Affection to God; yet that men ſhould be obliged to this or that Form of Words, or manner of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture in the Church, ſeems unreaſonable, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Words and Geſtures do not move all men alike.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> To uſe ſeveral Forms and Geſtures in the publick Congregation at once, would be very inconvenient, and a great hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to Devotion. For as to Words,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40186:123"/> wherein Prayer, Praiſe and Thankſgivings are offered to God in a public way, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite they ſhould be the ſame to all, as well to avoid Confuſion and Diſtraction, which otherwiſe would certainly fall out; as alſo for that Chriſtians meeting together to offer up in common, Prayer, Praiſe and Thanks to God, and deſiring the ſame things, ſhould uſe the ſame means to teſtifie their joynt Conſent and Concern (for the mutual Encouragement of their Devotion) in Chriſtianity, as Members of the ſame Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy under one Head Chriſt Jeſus. And in regard the ſame Form is convenient to be uſed by the whole Congregation, and that ſome of neceſſity muſt appoint the ſame, it is apparent to ſee, that the chief Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church (who being generally ancient and learned men, and conſtantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in matters of Religion, are the beſt able to do it well) ſhould have that Charge principally committed to them. And as for the Ceremonious part of Religious Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in public, ſince all decent Habits and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures are indifferent in themſelves to be made uſe of; and that it is evident, that the more public, and of greater Authority Eccleſiaſtical Perſons be, the eaſier and more obvious will it be for them to know
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40186:124"/> what Habits and Geſtures are eſteemed the moſt common and commendable Signs and Tokens of Decency, Humility and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, (which every private Perſon, who hath his particular Concerns to look after, and is not called by the Courſe of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to order Church Affairs, cannot do) it muſt in reaſon be granted, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Managers of Eccleſiaſtical Matters, the <hi>Prelates</hi> ought in prudence (ſeeing the Signs of Reſpect and Honour are different in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times and places, ſo as no Rule more than in general, could be left in <hi>Scripture</hi> for them) to be the Perſons entruſted to declare, appoint and enjoyn what Ceremonious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and Geſtures are to be uſed in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Public Divine Offices.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>SECT. XVII.</hi> The two great Sacraments inſtituted by Chriſt for the Benefit of his Church, Baptiſm and the Lords Supper were ordained to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to Charity, the one in procuring it, the other in preſerving it. Yea, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Divine Inſtitutions and Ordinances whatſoever, are only ſo many deſigned mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Helps thereunto.</head>
               <p n="1">1. WHatever Virtues or Chriſtian Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have hitherto been ſpoken of, 'tis apparent from what hath been ſaid of them, that they every one of them have their Accompliſhment in eſtabliſhing Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Souls of Men. And no leſs certain is it, that all other Ordinances of God, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the two great Sacraments of the Church, (to paſs by, for brevities ſake, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, Holy Orders, <hi>&amp;c.) Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> have no other end or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, ſave either to beget Charity in the Soul, or to advance it towards Perfection, being firſt ſeated there.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For, in that a <hi>Sacrament is an outward and viſible Sign of an inward and Spiritual
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:40186:125"/> given unto us, ordained by Chriſt himſelf as a Means whereby we receive the ſame, and a Pledg to aſſure us thereof;</hi> it is clear, that if Charity be the Spiritual Grace here intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is the End and Accompliſhment of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And that <hi>Charity</hi> is the Spiritual Grace here intended, is plain, not only from hence, that nothing is truly Virtuous, or of any prevalency towards the obtaining of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life, which is not done out of Love to God, (<hi>Sect. 14. Par.</hi> 1.) and from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Teſtimony, averring that all other Gifts, Graces and Performances without <hi>Charity</hi> profit nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. but alſo from the account given of the two menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Sacraments themſelves in the <hi>Churches Catechiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. For according to that, the inward and Spiritual Grace given in Baptiſm, is a <hi>Death unto Sin, and a new Birth unto Righteouſneſs;</hi> and Charity, in that it formally expells mortal Sin, and frees from everlaſting Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and the Torments of Hell, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal <hi>Righteouſneſs, Sect.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And to the Queſtion propoſed, what the Benefits be whereof we are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers by the eating and drinking the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40186:125"/> of the <hi>Lord's Supper?</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is made, <hi>the ſtrengthening and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing of our Souls by the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, as our Bodies are by the Bread and Wine;</hi> by which it is manifeſt, that in the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtrengthening of our Souls by ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Food, is the End of this great Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment attain'd. And as Bread and Wine are therefore ſaid to nouriſh the Body, becauſe being digeſted by the Stomach, they afford Chyle, which ſanguified, immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſheth and ſtrengthens it; ſo the Body and Blood of Chriſt crucified are there ſaid to nouriſh the Soul, becauſe being applied to it by Faith, they confirm it in Charity, which is the Spiritual Nouriſhment and Strength thereof, being that which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately unites it to <hi>God (Sect.</hi> 11.) and in the Souls Union with <hi>God</hi> is the Spiritual Life, Strength and Vigor thereof.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That then the Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is the Sacrament of <hi>Initiation,</hi> and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces <hi>Charity</hi> into the Soul; and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> the Sacrament of confirming and ſtrengthening <hi>the ſame,</hi> is in general made manifeſt. And how each of them in particular effects what it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for, ſhall be briefly ſeen.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:40186:126"/>7. <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which is the initiating Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, is not to be adminiſtred to any that are capable to underſtand to what intent it was ordained, till they give an account of their Belief of the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and make a ſerious and ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their unfeigned deſire and ſtedfaſt reſolution to forſake the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil;</hi> and to lead a <hi>godly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>ſober Life,</hi> in which if they be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and underſtand (as they ought to do) that the external waſhing with Water, or dipping therein, denotes the inward cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Soul from Sin; or a dying to Sin, and riſing again to newneſs of Life; and is a Seal likewiſe and Means thereof; how can it be doubted of, but that the Sacramental Action of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> being duly performed, ſhould to one ſo prepared, have the Effect it was intended for, and improve his holy purpoſe and reſolution of leading a new Life, into a real performance of the ſame? For to ſuppoſe the Soul rightly prepared, and immediately diſpoſed to receive <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm</hi> duly adminiſtred, and yet the <hi>Effect of Baptiſm,</hi> or <hi>Res Sacramenti</hi> not to follow, were to ſuppoſe an entire adequate Cauſe actually cauſing without its proper Effect enſuing; or a thing actually
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40186:126"/> to cauſe, and yet nothing anſwering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, actually cauſed, which is impoſſible.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And as to the <hi>Sacrament of the Lord's Supper,</hi> which is an Ordinance for Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and ſtrengthening of Grace; in that it repreſents unto us the bloody Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Saviour in a more ſolemn, ſacred and venerable manner, by <hi>Christ</hi>'s own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment and deſignation, than any other divine Inſtitution doth, it muſt certainly to him who comes with due Reverence and Devotion to that auguſt Myſtery and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Token of God's immenſe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing Love to Man, be the moſt effectual Means poſſible to cauſe a deep impreſſion of <hi>Charity</hi> in his Soul, and even raviſh and tranſport him with the <hi>Love</hi> of ſo good and gracious a God and Benefactor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. If the expulſion of Sin by the acceſſion of Charity be the Effect of the Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> then can no man be juſtified without being actually baptized with Water, although he really repent and be truly converted to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> If ſo be that external Baptiſm were the only Cauſe of the Remiſſion or taking away of mortal Sin, the conſequence would be good; but the deſire of Baptiſm for the waſhing away of Sin, may be ſo ardent
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:40186:127"/> and operative in ſome, that <hi>Charity</hi> will be obtained before the actual adminiſtration of the Sacrament; and whenſoever, and by what means ſoever <hi>Charity</hi> is introduced into the Soul, Mortal Sin is neceſſarily caſt out thereby (<hi>ſect. 11. par.</hi> 6.) But few without the Sacramental waſhing with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though piouſly diſpoſed, have the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of <hi>Charity</hi> compleated in them. Neither is <hi>Baptiſm</hi> given in vain even to thoſe whoſe mortal Sin is expelled out of the Soul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be adminiſtred; for ſince there are as many degrees of Righteouſneſs as there are of <hi>Charity (ſect. 11. par.</hi> 8, &amp; 9.) the actual receiving of that Sacrament will cauſe in them an encreaſe of <hi>Charity</hi> and ſo of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> which is never perfect till the Love of God be ſo ardent, that it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly burns up all the droſs of carnal and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affections in the Soul (<hi>Sect.</hi> 11.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. If the Belief of the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, and an earneſt deſire, and a ſtedfaſt reſolution to forſake Sin, and to lead a godly Life, be Diſpoſitions neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily required in thoſe who are to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, then is Infant-Baptiſm a fruitleſs and inſignificant thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> It is evident as well by the Office of Baptiſm, as by the Church-Catechiſm, that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:40186:127"/> Infants through their Sureties are engaged, before the Church will admit them to <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> (except in imminent danger of Death, in which Caſe the Church enjoyning ſpeedy Baptiſm, becomes it ſelf Surety thereby, and therefore orders that the Child, if it live, be brought into the public Congregation, and that the Godfathers and Godmothers undertake for it, like to what is done in public Baptiſm) to believe <hi>themſelves the Articles of Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and to renounce the <hi>World, the Fleſh</hi> and <hi>the Devil,</hi> when they come to Age, no leſs than ſuch as are of ripe years are obliged to declare they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready do unfeignedly all thoſe things; by which it appears that the Benefit which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues by <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to both, has a reference to, and proceeds on their part, upon the account and ground of a true profeſſion of <hi>Faith,</hi> and a real endeavour after <hi>Holineſs of Life.</hi> So that although <hi>Baptiſm</hi> be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to Children before they underſtand it, yet the effect and benefit of it (more than this, that they obtain thereby the grand Privilege of becoming Members of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, whence they are brought to enjoy the great Bleſſing of Chriſtian Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) takes not place, nor is reaped till they do. And thus it is eaſie to apprehend, as to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40186:128"/> thoſe Children that live till they have the uſe of Reaſon, how <hi>Baptiſm</hi> becomes profitable to them; whilſt if they get benefit thereby, they muſt perform what their Sureties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed for them; which if they unfeignedly do by cordially believing the <hi>Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> and by taking a firm reſolution, through the Grace of God, to live a godly Life; the Conſideration of the gracious Deſign of Chriſt's inſtituting of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to take away Sin, and of the ſolemn Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it by the Church for their ſake to that end, will, if the Conſideration be ſuch as it ſhould be, cauſe a loathing of Sin, and a real forſaking thereof for the Love of God. For why <hi>Baptiſm</hi> already paſt ſhould not through a ſerious reflecting on it (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when Confirmation is duly, according to the great importance of it, adminiſtred) be an effectual Means of cleanſing the heart from Sin, as well as it is by the earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thereof, before it be had, will not be eaſily, I believe, reſolved. The main dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to unfold, is, how <hi>Baptiſm</hi> can profit Children that die young. Thoſe who ſay that Grace is immediately infuſed by God, will be hard put to't to give a tolerable Reaſon, to what good purpoſe the Uſe of Means is, when the Effect receives no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40186:128"/> at all from them, but is wholly mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, as every Effect immediately produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by <hi>God</hi> is. To me it ſeems more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to ſay, that as thoſe Children who live till they be of years capable of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reaſon and Uſe of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Church to be informed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that they may make good the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Sureties, (without doing of which, their <hi>Baptiſm</hi> will not avail them to Salvation) ſo Infant-Children upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Soul and Body, are illuminated by their Angels (for, <hi>are they not miniſtring Spirits ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation?</hi> Heb. 1. 14. And that Baptized Children are ſuch, we be taught by the Anſwer to the ſecond Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in our Catechiſm, where the Word <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritor</hi> is rendred in the Latin <hi>Haeres,</hi> and in the Greek κληρονόμος) with the Knowledg of their <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> for then they are capable of apprehending any thing offered to the intellect, it proceeding from the diſpoſition of their Bodies, and not from the nature of their Souls, that they are ever uncapable of actually underſtanding. And ſeeing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to the Creature through Original Sin, is not by far ſo ſtrong, as that which is contracted by frequent Acts of ſinning,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40186:129"/> their affections will be inſtantly turned to God by virtue of their <hi>Baptiſm</hi> ſignified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. But however the Truth in this obſcure Point ſtand, this is certain, that, in regard Felicity conſiſts in the Love of God (<hi>ſect. 4. par.</hi> 13.) baptized Infants muſt, ſome way or other, obtain Charity before they arrive at Bliſs, or at leaſt upon the very inſtant of being poſſeſſed thereof. And how their Baptiſm ſhould be uſeful to them for the obtaining of Charity, except they have Knowledg of it; and by whom it ſhould be made known unto them, but by their Angels (unleſs miraculouſly, and Miracles are not wrought where there's no neceſſity of them) I do not underſtand. Yet ſince I know of no Divine Revelation, nor of any clear demonſtration, after what manner their Love of God depends upon their being baptized, I do not preſume to affirm that my delivered Thoughts are poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively true.</p>

For ſince <hi>to love God with all the Heart, with all the Soul, with all the Mind, and with all the ſtrength,</hi> Mark 12. 30. is required to the compleat, exact fulfilling of the Law; and that ſuch Love would perpetually take up all the Powers of the Soul; it is plain, that, in regard, while we live in this world, our Thoughts muſt be often employed in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care for the neceſſary accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Life, and in uſing Means to further our own and others Welfare here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, we cannot in this mortal ſtate ſo fully fix our Affections on God, as to have our Souls fully poſſeſſed of him.</p>

Men of Felicity, yet the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof is not becauſe of their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate oppoſition to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope;</hi> but for that they are totally inconſiſtent with <hi>Charity.</hi> For ſince that no Habit is truly virtuous but in virtue of the End whereto it ſerves, and that the End of all Virtues is <hi>Charity (ſect.</hi> 13, &amp; 14.) which perfected, is <hi>Felicity;</hi> it evidently follows, that there is not any Vice mortally vicious, or finally prejudicial to Man's Felicity, ſave only by reaſon of <hi>Charity</hi>'s inconſiſtency with it. But it is impoſſible that thoſe who either through <hi>Infidelity</hi> never believe; or through <hi>Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi> fall from the belief, that there is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Being which ought to be belov'd above all things, ſhould place their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on <hi>God:</hi> and equally impoſſible, that they who either through <hi>Preſumption</hi> or <hi>Deſpair,</hi> will not make uſe of the neceſſary Means, ſhould attain to the End to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by them. Whence it is manifeſt, that every one of theſe Vices are Mortal Sins, and neceſſarily, if not forſaken, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of Salvation. If it be replied, that every Sin is a Tranſgreſſion of the Law, and every Tranſgreſſion of the Law a Mortal Sin, no leſs than <hi>Infidelity, Apoſtaſie, Preſumption</hi> and <hi>Deſpair,</hi> and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:40186:132"/> of Salvation as well as they, I grant it to be true in every one abiding in the State of ſinful Nature; for ſince ſuch a Man's Will is habitually vitiated with the Love of the World above the Love of God, every Act proceeding from that Source or Principle, will partake of its Nature and Diſpoſition, and all ſuch Love is Mortal Sin, (<hi>Sect. 8. par.</hi> 5.)

Whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that they are on theſe accounts (ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting from this that they are Miniſterial to <hi>Charity</hi>) neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> That the owning the Truth of <hi>God</hi> by readily aſſenting and firmly adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Myſterious Truths revealed in the Scripture, and the owning the infinite Power and Goodneſs of <hi>God,</hi> are any Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues when they are not accompanied with <hi>Charity,</hi> beſides for the reaſon ſhewn, (<hi>ſect. 13. par.</hi> 1.) therefore deny, becauſe the Devil not only gives a moſt firm aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to every Divine Truth revealed in the Scripture, as knowing it to be the Word of <hi>God,</hi> and therefore infallibly true, but alſo owns, upon the ſame account, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power and Goodneſs of <hi>God,</hi> as they are there in every reſpect declared and ſet forth; and yet he is not at all virtuous in doing of either; yea, the ſtronger his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is to their Truth, the more wicked he is, becauſe he has not <hi>Charity</hi> anſwerable
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40186:133"/> to his <hi>Knowledg,</hi> in that he loves not <hi>God</hi> as the only Sovereign Good of all rational and intelligent Creatures, when he moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knows that he ought to be ſo beloved by them. If it be alledged, that <hi>Faith</hi> in the Objection is to be underſtood of a <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> I return, that if an Aſſent given to a Divine Truth upon the Credit of a Divine Teſtimony be Divine Faith, the Devil's Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Truths revealed in the Scripture is a Divine Faith: But if by Faith be meant a <hi>Saving Faith,</hi> then I grant the Devil is void thereof, becauſe his Faith is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>Charity,</hi> for all Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Charity</hi> is nothing worth, in reference to Salvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2.</p>
               <p n="7">7. As the principal Aim and Drift of the Precepts of the former Table of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue is the Love of God as Mans chiefeſt Good; (<hi>Par.</hi> 6.) ſo hath the Loving of our Neighbour likewiſe its Conſummation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For ſince Rational Nature is the ſame in all men, and conſequently the ſame End appointed for all Mankind; 'tis clear, that every Man, in that he is a Man, is obliged to wiſh and further the ſame final Good, and the Neceſſary Means conducible to it, to every one; and this is that, which is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>loving a Mans Neighbour as himſelf;</hi> whilſt
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40186:133" rendition="simple:additions"/> every other good one man ought to do to another, is a thing extrinſecal to man as man, and depends as to the Obligation thereto, on prudential Motives, or mutual Conſent explicit or implicit, or formal Contracts, for the Preſervation or Comfort of the animal Life, and is not ſo much as to be abſolutely prayed for, even for our ſelves, (<hi>Sect. 15. Par.</hi> 3.) and then certainly, not of neceſſity to be abſolutely wiſhed or done to others, as their final good Eſtate, and what neceſſarily conduceth to the obtaining of it, evermore are.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Seeing then to love a mans Neighbour as himſelf is heartily to wiſh and deſire that he may enjoy the ſame neceſſary good with himſelf, and to contribute his Aſſiſtance, when occaſion requires, to the furthering thereof, and that eternal Felicity is that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary good conſiſting in the perfect Love of God, (<hi>Sect. 4. Par.</hi> 13.) it is plain, that in heartily wiſhing and endeavouring alſo (when occaſion ſerves) that our Neighbour may attain to the ſincere Love of God here, and the perfect Love of God hereafter, <hi>We love our Neighbour as our ſelves,</hi> and <hi>thereby keep all the ſix last Commandments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. And foraſmuch as no man can poſſibly heartily wiſh to another either <hi>Grace or Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:40186:134"/> but becauſe of his own real deſire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to for himſelf <hi>firſt</hi> had, it is manifeſt, that he who loves his Neighbour as himſelf, doth evermore <hi>firſt,</hi> (at leaſt in order of nature) love God as his chiefeſt Good.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And becauſe the ſincere Love of God or Charity is formal Righteouſneſs, and that formal Righteouſneſs doth formally ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie (<hi>Sect. 11. Par.</hi> 8.) it directly follows that a man is formally Righteous or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified <hi>before</hi> (in order of Nature at leaſt) he love his Neighbour as himſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that the Love of our Neighbour is not any part of formal Righteouſneſs, but a neceſſary Effect and Conſequent thereof; which will farther appear to be a Truth from hence, that as on the one ſide, he who deſires and endeavours by his Council and Prayers his Neighbours Felicity, though he never attain thereto, performs his Duty to him, and thereby fulfils the Precepts of the latter Table, if ſo be he did them for the Love he bears to God, becauſe ſuch Love doth juſtifie, ſo on the other ſide, that he, who for Lucres ſake, or for Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Parts, or the like unworthy End, by rightly inſtructing his Neighbour and adviſing him well, truly converts him to God, is no more righteous thereby, than
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:40186:134"/> if he had done him no good at all; ſo that it is neither by reaſon of the Benefit which befalls a mans Neighbour by his Endeavours for his good; nor by reaſon of the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours themſelves, but becauſe of the true Love of God in the Heart exciting him to profit his Neighbour, in reference to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what he can, that a man is juſtified. Yea, that Love we owe to our Neighbour is of a different Kind or Species, from that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we love God, the former being the Love of <hi>Benevolence,</hi> the latter the Love of <hi>Complacency;</hi> for we do not make our Neighbour the Object of Felicity, or any coordinate part thereof with God; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that he may enjoy the ſame Object to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with us, which will make us both for ever happy.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> 3. If formal Righteouſneſs, or the fulfilling of the whole Moral Law conſiſts in the ſincere Love of God, and not at all in the loving a man's Neighbour as himſelf, it ſhould ſeem that the Love to a man's Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is not abſolutely neceſſary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe a juſtified Perſon, if he depart this World in that Condition, cannot at laſt fail of being for ever bleſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solut.</hi> When a man has attained to the ſincere Love of God himſelf, and knows
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:40186:135"/> (as he cannot otherwiſe chuſe but do from the Light of Nature) that he ought in a matter of neceſſary Concern to do as he would be done unto; and that eternal Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city is ſuch to all others, as well as to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; he muſt, except he'l contradict his own Thoughts, and forſake his true Love to God, wiſh, and promote likewiſe (when opportunity ſerves) his Neighbours Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which evidently makes it out, that a man cannot poſſibly be ſaved unleſs he love his Neighbour as himſelf. At length then it ſufficiently appears in general, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal reaſon of keeping the <hi>ſix laſt Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> as well as <hi>the four firſt,</hi> is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in that <hi>Charity,</hi> which is <hi>the Love of God above all things;</hi> and by conſequence, that in the <hi>Privation of that Love</hi> is the <hi>formal Breach</hi> of the <hi>whole Moral Law;</hi> the truth of both which, as to the ſix laſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhall (for clearer evidence) be in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular explicated and declared in the next Section.</p>

               <p>1. THE <hi>fifth Commandment</hi> of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, or firſt of the Second Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is, <hi>Honour thy Father and Mother;</hi> where by Father and Mother I take to be underſtood, according to the uſual Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, not our natural Parents only, but the Father of our Country alſo, and thoſe whom he ſets over us in the Civil Magiſtracy, as likewiſe our Spiritual Fathers, and other Inſtructers in good Literature and Virtue. All and every one of theſe we are by this Precept bound to <hi>honour;</hi> which is, if the act be <hi>internal,</hi> to acknowledg and own in our Minds an <hi>Excellency</hi> or <hi>Eminency</hi> in the Perſon to be honoured above our ſelves;
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:40186:136"/> but if the act be <hi>external,</hi> then the Honour required, is to expreſs by <hi>outward Signs</hi> the inward acknowledgment and owning of the honoured Perſon's Excellency in our hearts; which <hi>Excellency,</hi> ſince it doth not conſiſt in any eſſential difference, (the <hi>Sovereign</hi> and <hi>Subject, Father</hi> and <hi>Son, Prieſt</hi> and <hi>People, Maſier</hi> and <hi>Scholar,</hi> having all the ſame Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, and the <hi>ſame Definition,</hi> as they are <hi>Men</hi>) the Excellency of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign above his Subject, of the Father above his Child, of the Prieſt above his People, and of the Maſter above his Scholar, muſt be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the <hi>Relation</hi> which is between every one of them <hi>reſpectively,</hi> in regard of which all the former are truly and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſuperiour</hi> in <hi>Excellency</hi> to the latter; whilſt from the King as ſuch, the Subject has Protection of Life and Eſtate; from the Parents, Children receive their natural Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and means of Education; from the Prieſt, the People have Spiritual Inſtruction, and many other Helps of Salvation; and from the <hi>Maſter,</hi> the Scholar reaps the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Learning and good Diſcipline. Whence it appears, that the true Ground and Reaſon of the Honour required by this Commandment, is the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Benefit</hi> which every one to whom <hi>Honour</hi> is due
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40186:136"/> thereby, either actually affords, or is in a Capacity, and under an Obligation by the <hi>Relation</hi> he ſtands in, when a juſt occaſion ſerves to confer. And foraſmuch as none can be bettered by any Good, unleſs it be applied to him, 'tis neceſſary that every one who expects <hi>Benefit</hi> from his <hi>Superiour,</hi> be <hi>obedient to him,</hi> that is, be willing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be <hi>directed, guided</hi> and <hi>ruled</hi> by him, and thus comes <hi>Obedience</hi> as well as <hi>Honour</hi> to be due by the <hi>Fifth Commandment.</hi> But yet in regard nothing is abſolutely good to us (not very Life it ſelf, <hi>Sect. 15. Par.</hi> 3.) ſave only our <hi>Supream Good;</hi> the whole Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit we get by our <hi>Prince, Prieſt, Parents</hi> and <hi>Maſters,</hi> is then alone truly profitable to us in order to the End for which we were created, when the uſe we make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of proceeds from the <hi>Love of God,</hi> and tends to the <hi>Eternal Enjoyment</hi> of him. Hence it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that if thoſe our mentioned <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors</hi> command any thing which we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain will prove prejudicial to our <hi>Felicity,</hi> we have <hi>no Obligation</hi> upon us to do their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;</hi> from which it is clear, that the <hi>fifth Commandment</hi> is not truly kept but when we honour and obey our <hi>Prince, Prieſt, Parents</hi> and <hi>Maſters,</hi> for the <hi>Love</hi> we have to <hi>God</hi> in the perpetual <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of him. Neither
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40186:137"/> is there any real Breach of this Branch of the Law, but in the <hi>privation</hi> of <hi>ſuch Love,</hi> for nothing is <hi>evil,</hi> but as it deprives of ſome <hi>good</hi> whereunto it is oppoſite; and ſeeing nothing is intrinſecally good but <hi>Charity;</hi> nor relatively good, but what ſome way or other contributes to it, (<hi>Sect.</hi> 13, 14, 15.) nothing is evil, but either becauſe it <hi>deſtroys Charity,</hi> and then the Sin is <hi>Mortal;</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it <hi>weakens it,</hi> in which caſe the Offence is <hi>not Mortal,</hi> but (as the Schools for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſake call it) <hi>Venial.</hi> To <hi>diſhonour</hi> then our <hi>Superiors</hi> deliberately is a mortal Breach of this Precept, in that the Heart is thereby alienated from God, which thus comes to paſs. He that diſhonours his <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> or other his lawful <hi>Governours</hi> (which is through a perverſe Mind not to own the <hi>Good</hi> he receives, or might receive by them, nor the <hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>Pre-eminence</hi> they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire by reaſon thereof, above and over him) does thereby diſregard and ſlight thoſe <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits</hi> which <hi>God</hi> by them tenders to him; and in ſo doing, not only ſets ſlight of the <hi>Author</hi> of them, but alſo rejects the <hi>End,</hi> at which they ultimately aim, <hi>Felicity.</hi> No man therefore poſſibly can deliberately <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour</hi> his <hi>Parents,</hi> or other his <hi>Superiors,</hi> but his Heart will be thereby eſtranged from
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40186:137"/> God. But much more in wilfully <hi>diſobeying</hi> their juſt Commands, is there an Averſion from their <hi>Sovereign Good,</hi> for therein is a direct Refuſal of <hi>God's Goodneſs</hi> offered by them, whilſt every thing they lawfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is ſome way, more or leſs, directly or by conſequence, advantageous to the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Bliſs, if right uſe be made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>The <hi>6th. Commandment,</hi> which is <hi>Non occides; Thou ſhalt not kill, or, Thou ſhalt do no Murther,</hi> is not kept by a meer abſtaining from deſiring, contriving, or attempting the Death or bodily Harm of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; but in wiſhing, and doing likewiſe our Endeavour to preſerve his Life and Health in order to the eternal Welfare of his Soul; which we cannot do, ſave only as we are excited thereto by the Love we bear to our own Life, and good Eſtate of our Bodies, as ſerviceable to the End for which Life and all the Helps and Attendants of it were given. For neither Health nor Life ought to be deſired, if ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances occur, as that the Preſervation of them is inconſiſtent with the everlaſting Welfare of the Soul; which becauſe it is placed in the Fruition of God, the Love we have thereto is the principal reaſon and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40186:138"/> why we ought to deſire to continue in Life and Health our ſelves, or wiſh the like to our Neighbour, for making prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration towards the full Enjoyment of him after this Life is ended. And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the bare doing of bodily Harm to our Neighbour, or even the taking away of his Life, is no ſin ſimply in it ſelf conſidered, but in this reſpect only, that he who does it has not that due regard, for want of the <hi>Love of God,</hi> to the preſervation of it, which the importance thereof, in order to the end whereunto it was given, requires. For who is ignorant, that the Execution of the Penalties in Laws for capital Crimes is no Sin, either in the Judge who gives Sentence of Death, or in him that executes the ſame, provided they have no perſonal Malice to the Offender, but ſolely have an Eye to the ſatisfying of the Law, which intends not any Miſchief to the Malefactor, but Good to the Weal-public by removing an incorrigible Member from among the People. But if the Judg or Executioner deſire his Death out of hatred to him, albeit he deſerve to die, and be juſtly condemned and executed, there is Murther committed, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Party ſuffering has no more Torment inflicted on him than if no Malice
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40186:138"/> had been towards him; whence it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that the Breach of this Commandment lies in that depraved Diſpoſition of Mind, which is oppoſite to the ſound deſire of wiſhing a Man's Neighbour's bodily Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare in order to the Health of his Soul, which becauſe none ever heartily doth but in virtue of his own Love of Bliſs, the <hi>Want</hi> of <hi>that Love</hi> is the <hi>formal Reaſon</hi> why the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaving any one of Life, or working his bodily harm, is a <hi>ſin</hi> or hinderance to <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>7th. Commandment</hi> is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery;</hi> the Breach of which doth not conſiſt in the material Act of carnal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation with anothers Wife, but in forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Love of God for an unlawful Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For ſuppoſe a Wife ſhould leave her Husband, and be married to another Man inculpably ignorant of her former Marriage, the Woman alone would offend againſt this Precept, albeit the Man alſo tranſgreſſed the Letter of the Law, in carnally knowing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers Wife. Or in caſe a Man ſhould have his Neighbours Conſort put into his Bed, thinking her to be his own, he offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, although he ſhould commit the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Act of Adultery with her. And on the contrary, if an Husband lay with his
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:40186:139"/> own Wife, thinking her to be his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, he would in ſo doing ſin againſt this Precept, and yet no Tranſgreſſion of it would thereby be made as to the external Act prohibited. Hence it is plain, that the Violation of the <hi>Seventh Comandment</hi> is in the depraved Affection of the Will, in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Heart away from the <hi>Love of God</hi> to unchaſt Pleaſures; and that it is kept by having a Mind undefiled with fleſhly Luſts, which every one ſo long hath, as <hi>Charity</hi> or the Love of God above all things is predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in the Soul. If it be objected, that ſimple Fornication alſo alienates the Heart from God, through the deſire of unlawful Venereal Pleaſures, whence it ſhould be a ſin no leſs grievous then Adultery; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that he who attempts to pollute his Neighbours Bed, knows that he ought upon a double account not to do it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Neighbours Wife is not tied in a Matrimonial Bond to him. <hi>Secondly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe is bound to another; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will have his Heart more hardned in ſin, or farther eſtranged from God, than if he only deſired to ſatisfie his Luſt with one, from whom upon the former account alone, he holds himſelf to be reſtrained, and ſo the ſin of Adultery, (all Circumſtances
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:40186:139"/> being equal) is a more heinous Tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, than the Sin of ſimple Fornication is.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40186:153"/> the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Dominion</hi> to do.

Yet I expreſly there ſay, that it is only by his <hi>Eternal immutable Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and that they no otherways engage his <hi>Will,</hi> ſave only to make the <hi>beſt Choice;</hi> not that God was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver undetermined in his <hi>Will,</hi> ſince it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> being eſſential to him, ſhould not perpetually neceſſarily know; and his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> no leſs eſſential to him, ſhould not perpetually neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40186:155"/> him to will, what is <hi>beſt</hi> or moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to <hi>both,</hi> and equally impoſſible that his <hi>will,</hi> not really but notionly only diſtinct from either (whatſoever is in God being God, <hi>Sect. 1. Par.</hi> 11.) ſhould not act according to them; ſo that as all the internal Actings of God are <hi>eſſentially wiſe</hi> and <hi>eſſentially good,</hi> ſo are they likewiſe <hi>eſſentially neceſſary,</hi> whilſt the Divine Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Will are eſſentially the ſame, and his internal Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings nothing elſe but his very Will eſſentially actuated with Wiſdom and Goodneſs, and by conſequence eternally and neceſſarily ſo actuated. And therefore the Inſtance from the neceſſity of communicating the Divine Nature by the Father to the Son and Holy Spirit, for proof that the World was not neceſſarily created, in ſtead of diſproving the neceſſity of the Worlds Creation, is clearly an Argument for it. For ſeeing the Communication of the Divine Nature is rendred by the Objection (and truly) the neceſſary Reſult of the infinite Goodneſs and Perfection of God, it plainly argues a greater Perfection in an intelligent Being, to act out of neceſſity of Nature, then to act with that Freedom which ſuppoſes a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of acting, or not acting, or pleaſure, and conſequently, in regard there are no
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40186:155"/> degrees of Perfection in God, who is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Perfection it ſelf, that the Creation was as well a neceſſary as voluntary Product of the Divine Will, and that the reaſon why the Univerſe is not of infinite Perfection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Maker of it, is from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity of the Subject, accordingly as was ſhewn, <hi>Sect. 3.

                  <p>The World was incapable of exiſting e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally; for ſince the glorious Structure thereof was ſucceſſively made, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneouſly (as is clear from the account we have of its Origin, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 1. and from theſe words alſo, <hi>On the ſeventh day God ended his Work which he had made,</hi> Gen. 2. 2.) it implies a Contradiction that it ſhould have been eternal; for what was done on the ſecond, third, fourth, fifth and ſixth day of the Creation, could not poſſibly be eternal, otherwiſe whatſoever was done on any of thoſe days would have been done as ſoon as that which was done on the firſt day, which is impoſſible, becauſe what was not done till the ſecond, third, fourth, fifth or ſixth day could not be done before, unleſs the ſame thing might be done and not be done at the ſame time. And as what was done on the ſix latter days could not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, ſo neither that which was done on the firſt; for in regard the firſt day was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one day before the ſecond, two days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the third, three days before the fourth, four days before the fifth, and five days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſixth; it is not poſſible that what
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40186:156"/> was done on the firſt day ſhould be any more eternal, then what was done upon any of the other, except the addition of one day to two, three, four, or five others could make their finite Number infinite. If it be ſaid that this indeed rationally makes it out, that the World, ſuppoſing the manner of the Creation as it is related by <hi>Moſes,</hi> could not be eternal. But what if God had pleaſed to create the World in its full entire Glory inſtantaneouſly at once, might it not then have been created from Eternity? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not, for otherwiſe there would have been infinite ſucceſſions of times and things, which in <hi>Sect. 3. Par.</hi> 4. is made out to be impoſſible. And therefore although it be not very apparent to Mans Underſtanding, but that ſomething inſtantaneouſly made by God might poſſibly be eternal. Yet that any ſuch thing could be created from eternity, the Creation whereof would imply the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of contradictory aſſertions to become true from thence, (as from the Eternity of the World, wherein things continually ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed one another the Creation thereof would do, <hi>Sect. 3.

                  <p>As to the former part of the Verſe, <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himſelf,</hi> I find one Expoſition of it in the <hi>Critics,</hi> againſt which, I think, nothing can be juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, to wit, <hi>Omnia operatus eſt Dominus

And the like muſt <hi>pari ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione</hi> be held of all other rational Animals, if any ſuch there be in the Univerſe beſides, as alſo of every Angelical Nature, whoſe Chiefeſt Good and Ultimate End and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection muſt conſiſt in the Viſion of God. Yea, and meer corporeal Subſtances, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have not an immediate Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency towards God, yet are they neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerviceable to Man (at leaſt) who has, in that the circumſtant material World is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely requiſite to his Generation, Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Augmentation, Conſervation, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Perfection, whilſt by the Organs of Senſe, on which are no Operations wrought but by Corporeal Objects and Agents with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, he attains to the Knowledge, Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and Love of God; ſo that all things, either <hi>mediately</hi> or <hi>immediately</hi> appear to acquire their <hi>

For
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40186:158"/> ſince nothing is good, but in reſpect of ſome Convenience of Profit or Pleaſure which accrues by it to whom it is good, 'tis clear, that God, in whom is the Fulneſs of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is totally incapable of receiving Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from the Creature. And no leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible is it that he ſhould acquire Pleaſure or obtain Delight from any thing without himſelf; for what is of infinite Excellency is infinitely delightful, which becauſe the prime independent Being God is, he muſt needs be infinitely delighted in the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of himſelf; and to ſay there can be an acceſſion of Pleaſure to infinite Pleaſure, is in effect to ſay that Infinity is not infinite. But farther I ſhew the Impoſſibility of God's receiving Pleaſure from any Performances of the Creature thus: Whatſoever Pleaſure the Almighty has, it is either eſſential to him, or accidental; eſſential he can have none, but what is neceſſarily intrinſecal to his very Nature, and ſuch is not the ſuppoſed Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ariſing from the Honour exhibited to God by the Creature. And to ſay that any Pleaſure by way of accident is in God, or of a different Nature from his Eſſence, is to deny him to be the moſt Simple, and in Conſequence thereto the moſt Perfect Being, for what is not moſt ſimple, is ſome way or
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40186:158"/> other compounded, and all Compoſition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes Imperfe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ion, becauſe in every Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition the Parts compounding muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be of a finite and limited Nature; for if either, or both Parts (ſuppoſing there be only two) were of infinite Perfection, there could be no Compoſition made, by reaſon that in one Infinite would be the entire Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of whatever could be in both Parts, and ſo there would be nothing more in the Whole or Compound, than in one Part thereof; which ſince it is repugnant to the Nature of whole and Parts, the Reality of ſuch a Compoſition is impoſſible, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in God who is eſſentially infinite in Perfection. As to the latter part of the Verſe in the Objection, <hi>viz. even the Wicked for the Day of Evil;</hi> Dr. <hi>Patrick</hi> in his Paraphraſe on the Text tells us, <q rend="margDblQuotes">That it hath exerciſed many Pens to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when the Senſe is clear, which is this: The Lord diſpoſeth all things throughout the World to ſerve ſuch ends, as he thinks fit to deſign, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refuſe to comply with; for if any Men be ſo wicked, as to oppoſe his Will, he will not loſe their Service, but, when he brings a Calamity upon a Country, employ them to be the Executioners of

Neither is it any Tautology (which the deſigned Brevity of the Lords Prayer compoſed by Divine Wiſdom neceſſarily, I confeſs, acquits it of) when we have firſt prayed in general that the whole Creation, whereof Man is a Part, may glorifie God in the attainment chiefly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40186:160"/> of their reſpective Ends, to crave more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for our ſelves, and all others of the ſame Species with us, the End for which Man was created; whilſt to pray ſo firſt in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral is a proper operative Means and Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to cauſe us to deſire more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly and with greater ardency of Devotion, that we and our Neighbour may not our ſelves fail of the End of our Creation, when we have already begged that every thing whatſoever may acquire its Perfection. If God, you'l ſay be glorified chiefly in the acquiſition of the End for which things were created, it ſhould ſeem that he is not at all glorified in the Damnation of Reprobate Men and Angels, in that they neither obtain the End for which Rational and Intelligent Natures were created, nor obſerve the Laws conducible thereunto; I anſwer, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do not glorifie God after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner intended in the Lord's Prayer; yet their Condition nevertheleſs is not ſuch, but that Glory redounds thereby to God, and that not only in regard of their Beings (whereof they would not be deprived, as will hereafter be ſhown in the <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the 9. <hi>Obj.</hi>) which are of God; but alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that forſaking him, and placing their Affections on other Objects never to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,

                  <p>To this Inquiry, in which the whole dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty is wound up, I thus make anſwer; Since it was the good Pleaſure of God to prevent the grand ſad effect which the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apple would of neceſſity have produced, I mean <hi>Adam</hi>'s and <hi>Eves</hi> eternal Miſery, in caſe they had not returned to love God as their Sovereign Good, it was requiſite to let them underſtand the danger of tranſgreſſing the Almighties Command, not only in regard of what was paſt, but alſo of what was to come; which to do in a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40186:161"/> way connatural and ſuitable to their State, ſeems in reaſon to have been the very ſame which the Almighty took. For whereas our firſt Parents were put into the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> abounding with Variety of what was good and grateful to them, thereby to incline them to be thankful, to give Praiſe and Honour to God, and above all, to love him as the Author and Giver of every good thing they enjoy'd, what ſo connatural a Courſe even to the eye of Human Reaſon could have been taken to bring them home to himſelf again by Repentance, as to turn them out of the pleaſant Enjoyments they in the State of their Integrity had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced; and for that end to make the Earth ſo barren, as that without the Sweat of their Brows it ſhould not yield them neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Maintenance? And then, foraſmuch as God works not Miracles where natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are ſufficient to effect his Purpoſe, 'tis moſt reaſonable to think, that the Earth was made leſs fruitful, in the way which in the Objection it is ſuppoſed that it might fall out, to wit, by cauſing that Motion of the Earth (or Courſe peradventure of the Sun, it matters not whether) which makes difference of Seaſons, and alteration of the Air; whence alſo Sickneſſes and Diſeaſes
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40186:162"/> would be apt to grow, and ſo conſtant cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Miſery and Mortality be in all Ages ready at hand to put Men in mind of their frail and ſinful Condition, and thence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come (not tormentive Revenges, but) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Means, Motives and Inducements to make them fly with ſorrow of Heart and full purpoſe of amending their Lives, (for Wickedneſs even in the apprehenſion of the very Pagans was the Cauſe of the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which befel Men) to God for Succour, Help and Comfort, and ſo to build their Hopes, and put their Truſt in him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to love him as their Sovereign Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. If it be replied that what has yet been ſaid falls ſhort of reſolving the main difficulty, which is, how the eating of the Fruit could be the connatural Cauſe, or a neceſſary Motive to God, for altering either the Courſe of the Sun, or the Motion of the Earth, by which the Air became diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Sin of Man? My Anſwer is, <hi>firſt,</hi> that admitting there was a Change either of the annual courſe of the Sun, or of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earth from what it was at firſt, it will, I think, be hard to give any other good account, why the Change was made, ſave only that which has been given already, namely for embarrening the Earth, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40186:162"/> bringing Diſtempers and Diſeaſes on Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to drive them in a manner to have a ſenſe of their ſinful ſad Condition, to the end they might caſt themſelves upon the Mercy and Goodneſs of God, and place their Affections on him for the ſame. But I anſwer <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that there is in truth no neceſſity to grant there was any different Courſe of the Sun, or Motion of the Earth, from what it was annually afterward; for the <hi>Omniſcient</hi> eternally comprehending at once what will ever be the Effects as well of all voluntary as neceſſary Cauſes, could not chuſe but know that <hi>Adam</hi> would volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily fall from the State wherein he created him, and exactly at what time; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordered from Eternity ſuch a ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly various Courſe of the Sun, or Motion of the Earth, as would be congruous both to the Eſtate of Mans Integrity, and of his lapſed Condition, for helping him on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Felicity. For that <hi>Adams</hi> Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Paradiſe was but ſhort, may be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally inferred from hence, that the craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Serpent</hi> could not be ignorant that the longer our firſt Parents perſevered in the Practice of Obedience, and frequent pious Duties, ſeriouſly performed to God, the harder ſtill it would be for him to overcome
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40186:163"/> them by his deſigned Temptation, in that Habits are evermore ſtrengthened and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the iteration of Act; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, queſtionleſs he would not omit (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially conſidering his violent reſtleſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to do Miſchief) the very firſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of aſſailing them, (and we do not read of any more Temptations of his offered to them but only one) ſo that their Fall might very well be before the Airs Diſtemper could happen, though the annual Courſe of the Sun, or Motion of the Earth, was never different from what it is at preſent. If it be alledged, that ſuch Knowledge in God as has been mentioned, muſt either be the cauſe of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, and conſequently of Sin, (which would be Blaſphemy to affirm) or elſe it muſt proceed from, and depend upon the Fall, as the Object whence it is derived; (which would be abſurd to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert) I anſwer, there is no neceſſity of granting either, for as to Sin, ſince it is a meer Privation <hi>Sect. 8. Par.</hi> 3, 4.) 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible there ſhould be any efficient cauſe thereof. And in that every Man knows his own Thoughts and Actions without a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor, or receiving notice of them from any thing beſides himſelf; is it not evident, that, if God be as <hi>primarily intimate</hi> to a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40186:163"/> Man's Thoughts and Actions, as the Man himſelf is, he'l as <hi>primarily know</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of and from himſelf the Man's Thoughts and Actions, as the Man himſelf doth from himſelf? And that God is as <hi>primarily inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> to every Man's Thoughts and Actions, as the Man himſelf is, appears from hence, that in whatever any of them is diſtant from pure nothing, it has the ſame by the Divine Power, Will or Mind intrinſically concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Production of it; and ſo God muſt of neceſſity as <hi>primarily know it,</hi> and as <hi>intimately</hi> as the Man knows it himſelf. Nor is the mentioned Divine Concurrence, let Man's Thoughts and Actions be what they will, any cauſe at all of Sin, for Thoughts and Actions are never ſinful as ſuch, they are only ſinful when, and as, they are directed and tend to a wrong end, (and ſuch Direction and Tendency proceeds wholly from Man, and not in the leaſt from God) by which the Mind is alienated and turned away from the Object of Felicity; for in the Alienation and Averſion of the Mind from God, in whoſe Fruition Felicity is placed, doth Sin <hi>formally</hi> conſiſt, <hi>Sect. 8.

Yea, conſidering that Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of all the Glory of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection-Body, if the Glory of our firſt Bodies was inferior to it, the Foundation of the <hi>Praeexiſtentiarian Hypotheſis</hi> is totally razed; which is, That the <hi>Almighty</hi> made all <hi>Creatures</hi> in the <hi>beſt Happiest,</hi> and moſt <hi>perfect Condition</hi> that their reſpective Natures rendred them <hi>capable</hi> of. This in Anſwer to the <hi>eighth Argument.</hi> And as to the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, all the Motives recited in them for cauſing the Soul to perſevere in Bliſs once again obtained, by fixing its Affections unalterably on God, fall ſo far ſhort of the immenſe Power, Force and Efficacy which the <hi>full Fruition</hi> of <hi>God</hi> by <hi>clear Viſion</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords to that end, that the <hi>Diſproportion</hi> between them, in that very reſpect, is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable;</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:40186:168"/> inſomuch that if the Soul were capable of infinite influx, the <hi>Beatific Viſion</hi> would infinitely raviſh it with the <hi>Delight thereof.</hi> And therefore, if ever we had been in that height of Felicity which the Author of <hi>Lux Orientalis, chap. 4. p.</hi> 113. holds we once enjoyed, we could not voluntarily have deſerted the ſame; and that God, by whoſe <hi>meer Goodneſs</hi> it was beſtowed, ſhould have thruſt us from it, is incredible; and if neither we had forſaken God, nor God us, we ſhould certainly have remained for ever happy. If it be ſaid, that the <hi>triple vital Congruity</hi> would have been given by God in vain, if it had never been exerted, my Anſwer is, that all good Souls did not lapſe, but that ſome ſtill continue in Bliſs, <hi>Lux Orientalis, Chap. 14. p.</hi> 119. And the <hi>Annotator</hi> in his eighth Argument, we ſaw, allows the <hi>triple vital Congruity</hi> to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny us in the <hi>next world;</hi> in caſe there be any ſuch thing as that Congruity is ſaid to be.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>This, I own, ſtrikes all ſure indeed; but to have recourſe to the <hi>Divine Promiſe</hi> to do it, is, after all the high <hi>Efforts</hi> of <hi>Wit</hi> and elegant <hi>Philoſophical Eſſays</hi> that have been uſed by the <hi>Praeexistentiaries,</hi> to leave their fine <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> to ſhift at length as it can, for any help that's to be had from <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi> at the upſhot of all, when it ſhould have received its conſummation from it; and might in reaſon have expected it, if in truth it had been really founded on a ſound <hi>Philoſophical Bottom.</hi> For though the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> of <hi>God</hi> muſt of neceſſity ſtand <hi>firm,</hi> yet in that he does not uſe to accompliſh the ſame, but by ſomething which <hi>immediately</hi> brings it to paſs, and eſtabliſheth it, there muſt be a more <hi>immediate</hi> Cauſe of fixing the Saints in <hi>everlaſting Bliſs,</hi> than the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Promiſe;</hi> and the <hi>Beatific Viſion</hi> is (as has been ſhewn) that very <hi>Cauſe.</hi>

                     <hi>Angelic</hi> Nature, you'l ſay, is a much more ſublime and excellent Conſtitution than Humane; and therefore the <hi>lapſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> fell from an higher pitch of Glory than the <hi>Praeexistentiaries</hi> ſuppoſe <hi>lapſed Souls</hi> to have done; I anſwer, That comparatively they did not; for the Author of <hi>Lux Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entalis</hi> writes, that <hi>Bleſſed Souls</hi> were in the <hi>higheſt Bliſs</hi> their Natures rendred them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable

Add to this (for a ſtill more clear manifeſtation of the Reaſonableneſs of God's creating the World, notwithſtanding the endleſs affliction which befalls part of the Creatures) that the State of the Damned is, in their own Thoughts, ſo much more preferable to Non-exiſtence, as that their <hi>Minds</hi> are ſo ſet and fixed upon their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently beloved Objects, that they would not forgo and part with the longing deſire and Love they have to them, for the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Bliſs; it being impoſſible that they, whoſe Affections are totally bent on Riches,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40186:174"/> Honour, Luxury, Revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould have any real deſire to be united to God with the entire affection of their Spirit, in which Felicity doth alone conſiſt. If it be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſince the Reprobate, for fear only of the Judgment of the laſt day, ſhall call upon the Mountains to fall upon them and hide them, how much more is it probable, that they'l deſire to be annihilated and ceaſe to be, when they feel the intolerable Pains of Hell? I make anſwer, that albeit the Wicked are terribly afraid of the Day of Doom, and that the Damned rage for the extremity of their Torments; yet it is not conſequent thereto, that they'l deſire Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence to avoid them. For though it were granted to be really in it ſelf more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible not to exiſt, than to ſuffer exquiſite Torments; yet ſince the Reprobate do not deſire what would be better for them, but what they judge to be ſo; unleſs it be true, that they are actually willing to deſert, and for ever to forgo the love of thoſe things which they have abſolutely and fully fixed their Affections on, it cannot be, that they ſhould ſteadily deſire not to be, becauſe a permanent adherence of <hi>Mind</hi> to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their Luſts, and a real deſire of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence are inconſiſtent together. And
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40186:175"/> that the Damned will never deſert the Love they have to the Objects of their Luſts, may be apprehended from this, that, ſeeing they have adjudged them to be abſolutely good and neceſſary, as without which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think of any ſatisfaction to themſelves; to ſuppoſe their Affections taken off the Objects of their Luſt, were in effect to ſuppoſe them to love, and not to love the ſame thing at once. And therefore though the Damned ſhould have ſuch Thoughts as theſe, we wiſh we had never been born, we wiſh we were annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; yet in regard they nevertheleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their ſtrong and preſſing deſires to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their coveted Objects, it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the latter are their fixed Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and the former only incompleat wiſhes, ſince they cannot be cordially poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of both at the ſame time, an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute unbridled luſting after their beloved Objects, and an abſolute fixed deſire of Non-exiſtence, being utterly inconſiſtent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

                  <p>That ſome men die ſooner, ſome later, is generally from the Power and Force of natural Cauſes, which are ordained and ordered indeed by God, yet not on purpoſe to bring this or that particular Perſon to his End, at this or that appointed time, and after this or that preciſe manner; but they have their natural Influence, and ſet determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Courſe in the Univerſe, to contribute every one of them in their Kind and Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the bringing to paſs the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive

                  <p>Since the Chriſtian inſtanced in does what is commanded ſo far forth, as that the Lookers on have ſufficient cauſe to believe he has committed Idolatry, the <hi>Church</hi> ought to eſteem and cenſure him as an Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later for what he has done, by reaſon it cannot judg of the Heart, but by outward Signs, and inappearance he has committed Idolatry. But yet if you'l go to the exact definition of Idolatry, you'l find the Fact comes not within the compaſs of it; (and that Sin, which will not come under the definition of Idolatry, you muſt needs grant cannot be, truly ſpeaking, the Sin of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry) for <hi>Idolatry is a Crime which exhibits the honour due to God alone, to another Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;</hi> and therefore, ſince the bowing down of the Body is not an Act appropriated to the <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> for we lawfully and laudably bow unto our <hi>Prince, Parents,</hi> and <hi>others in Authority</hi> over us (of which there

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40186:179"/> the ſight of God? Yes undoubtedly he is a very grievous Offender even before God, as well as men; for he not only ſcandalizes Chriſtianity, in giving the Enemies of it an occaſion to triumph, in hardening them in their idolatrous Worſhip, and in encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to proceed to perſecute Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans with hope of deſired ſucceſs; but alſo in diſheartning of the weaker Brethren; in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them to ſtagger in the Faith, and in grieving all the Members of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; to do any one of which, is a great Sin, but to do all of them together, is a Crime of complicated Scandal to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt, which at once inſtructeth and exhorteth, ſaying, <hi>Be not afraid of them that kill the Body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you whom ye ſhall fear; fear him, which after he hath killed, hath power to cast into Hell; yea, I ſay unto you, fear him,</hi> Luke 12. 4, 5. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall confeſs me before men, him ſhall the Son of man alſo confeſs before the Angels of God: But he that denieth me before men, ſhall be denied before the Angels of God,</hi> Luke 12. 8, 9. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf and take up his Croſs and follow me. For whoſoever will ſave his Life ſhall loſe it, and whoſoever will loſe his Life for my ſake,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40186:179"/> ſhall find it,</hi> Matth. 16. 24, 25. So that the committing of Idolatry to the eye of the world, tho to ſave a man's Life, is an hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Sin, both in the ſight of God and all good men. If you ſay, that in ſome caſe even external Geſtures of Body are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated unto <hi>God,</hi> as namely, when and where Divine Worſhip is ſolemnly paid by the Congregation to him; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, that if it be really ſo, then in that caſe the giving external honour to any thing beſides God, is, I own, Idolatrous. But the example of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Congregation, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 20. ſeems clearly to gainſay, that bodily Geſtures betokening Honour, even at the time and place of exhibiting Divine Worſhip, are appropriated unto God; for it is there written, <hi>And David ſaid to all the Congregation, Now bleſs the LORD your God: And all the Congregation bleſſed the LORD God of their Fathers, and bowed down their Heads, and worſhipped the LORD and the King.</hi> The laſt Clauſe of this Text is rendred in the <hi>Polyglot</hi> by the interlinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Verſion, <hi>Et inclinaverunt ſe &amp; incurva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verunt ſe Domino &amp; Regi;</hi> in the Vulgar Latine, <hi>Et inclinaverunt ſe, &amp; adoraverunt Deum &amp; deinde Regem;</hi> and in the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. By all or any of which Words, there is not the leaſt difference to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned of the external Honour which the Congregation gave to God and to the King; the ſame corporeal Geſture being uſed alike to both; and yet the honour intended to be given by that Geſture was certainly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed into Religious and Civil; which we muſt therefore ſuppoſe to have been done by an internal Act of the Mind, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting the former unto <hi>God,</hi> and the later unto the <hi>King.</hi> But beſides that this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular place of Scripture neceſſarily requires this expoſition for vindicating the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from the guilt of Idolatry; how plainly reaſonable is it, that all bodily Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures ſhould be no otherwiſe regarded or valued, ſave as they proceed from the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Soul, which commands and orders them to what end it pleaſes, ſince if they be conſidered apart from that, they are nothing elſe than animal motion; but co-operating together with it in the ſame individual Act, whether good or bad, they are partakers with it therein, and from thence reputed to be virtuous or vicious, accordingly as the Act of the Mind, with which they concur to produce one and the ſame outward Action, is held to be.</p>

Firſt,</hi> That <hi>Chriſt's death</hi> on the Croſs was of <hi>infinite</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and merit. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>by</hi> and <hi>through</hi> the ſame, <hi>Remiſſion of Sin, Juſtification,</hi> and every other <hi>Good,</hi> whether of <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Glory,</hi> are obtain'd. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>Chriſt's Crucifixion</hi> was as real and proper an <hi>expiatory Sacrifice</hi> for Sin, as any under the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> (but of infinitely more value) ever was. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That God's <hi>Juſtice</hi> is <hi>de jure</hi> prevented <hi>thereby</hi> from being exerted
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40186:183"/> agaiſt Sinners in their everlaſting Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The only difference then (if any) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining is in this, That I cannot apprehend, what ſome others perchance think, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt's Merits <hi>operate upon God,</hi> and work an <hi>Effect</hi> of Mercy and Favour in his <hi>Will,</hi> whereas I humbly conceive them to be a <hi>ſecondary</hi> efficient Cauſe <hi>ſubſervient</hi> to <hi>God's Love</hi> to <hi>Man,</hi> for conveying and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the ſame unto him, by being an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Means of <hi>converting</hi> his Affections from the Vanities of the World unto God, that he may be eternally ſaved; for which I offer to ſerious conſideration theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reaſons inducing me thereto. 1. That <hi>Chriſt's</hi> moſt gracious <hi>doings</hi> and <hi>ſufferings</hi> for Man, are held by all <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be a <hi>Meritorious Cauſe. 2ly.</hi> That a <hi>Meritorious Cauſe</hi> is an <hi>efficient Cauſe. 3ly.</hi> That it is the Property of an <hi>Efficient Cauſe</hi> to work ſome <hi>real Effect. 4ly.</hi> That it ſeems plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any <hi>real Effect</hi> ſhould be wrought in <hi>God,</hi> who is <hi>impaſſible</hi> and <hi>immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table (ſect. 1. par.</hi> 8, 9.) for otherwiſe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>whatſoever is in God is God (ſect. 1. par. 11.) ſuch an Effect would be God himſelf,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Merits of Chriſt</hi> would be the <hi>effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Deity. 5ly.</hi> That <hi>Chriſt's Merits</hi> therefore are not an <hi>antecedent,</hi> but
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40186:183"/> a <hi>ſubſequent</hi> Cauſe to the <hi>merciful-loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs</hi> of God to Man, by which the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Goodneſs actually</hi> confers all the <hi>happy Effects</hi> of <hi>divine Favour</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> on him, whereby he is delivered from <hi>Sathan, Sin,</hi> and <hi>Damnation,</hi> and brought to <hi>everlaſting Bliſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be replied, that however plauſible, yea, certainly true, this arguing be, yet there is ſomething <hi>more</hi> in Chriſt's Suffering for the Sin of Man, than what hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been ſaid, namely, <hi>the ſatisfying Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice;</hi> I anſwer, that ſtrictly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, neither <hi>Juſtice</hi> nor <hi>Mercy,</hi> nor other <hi>Attributes</hi> of God are <hi>formally</hi> diſtinct, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from one another, or from the very Eſſence of the Deity (<hi>Sect. 1.

Though ye offer me Burnt-offerings, and your Meat-Offerings, I will not accept them, neither will I regard the Peace-offerings of your fat Beaſts,</hi> Amos 5. 21, 22. But of the <hi>inward Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Heart, Contrition,</hi> thus ſaith the <hi>Royal Prophet, The Sacrifice of God is a troubled Spirit, a broken and contrite Heart, O God, ſhalt thou not deſpiſe,</hi> Pſal. 51. 17. And in all ſincere Contrition, a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> is always neceſſarily impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for whoever in good earneſt bewails his ſin, cannot while ſo doing continue in a voluntary courſe of ſinning. There was then <hi>no Remiſſion</hi> of Sin <hi>before God,</hi> even under the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but that Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, notwithſtanding their obſervance of its <hi>external Ordinances,</hi> were liable to <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,</hi> yea, and that <hi>Temporal</hi> alſo, as well as <hi>Eternal,</hi> as is evident from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties afflicting the <hi>Jewiſh Nation</hi> with Plagues, Famines and Captivity for their ſins, (to prevent the ſinning ſtill anew, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the Aggravation of the Pain of ſuch as he knew would never be reclaim'd, and to be a Motive to the reſt to leave their wicked ways) in this World, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting thoſe that continued obſtinate and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40186:186"/> impenitent to everlaſting Miſery in the World to come; for <hi>no Repentance, no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; He that covereth his Sin ſhall not proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh them ſhall have Mercy,</hi> Prov. 28. 13. <hi>Let the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forſake his Way, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous Man his Thoughts, and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have Mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon,</hi> Iſa. 55. 7. <hi>It may be that the Houſe of</hi> Judah <hi>will hear all the Evil which I purpoſe to do unto them, that they may return every Man from his evil Way, that I may forgive their Iniquity, and their Sin,</hi> Jerem. 36. 8. <hi>If the Wicked will turn from all his Sins that he hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and keep all my Statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die. All his Tranſgreſſions that he hath committed, they ſhall not be mentioned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, in his Righteouſneſs that he hath done, he ſhall live,</hi> Ezek. 18. 21, 22. Neither are Sins <hi>remitted</hi> in the time of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> any more than they were in the time of the <hi>Law,</hi> unleſs <hi>forſaken,</hi> as might be proved from many <hi>Texts</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> of which, for brevities ſake, I will produce ſome few plain ones; <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh,</hi> Luke 13. 3. 5. <hi>Repent
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40186:187"/> ye therefore and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out,</hi> Acts 3. 19. <hi>But ſhewed firſt unto them of</hi> Damaſcus <hi>and at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and throughout all the Coasts of</hi> Judea, <hi>and then to the Gentiles, that they ſhould repent and turn unto God, and do works meet for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> Acts 26. 20. <hi>Let every one that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Name of Christ depart from Iniquity,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 19. as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, Let no Man preſume that <hi>Chriſt</hi> will <hi>ſave</hi> any one who is a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> unleſs by <hi>virtue</hi> of his <hi>Christianity</hi> he <hi>depart from iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since then it is apparent that there is <hi>no Pardon</hi> of ſin without <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> unto <hi>God,</hi> and that the <hi>deſign</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Expiation</hi> in <hi>Moſes's</hi> Law, was to be a <hi>Motive</hi> and <hi>Cauſe</hi> to incline Men to call their ſins to <hi>remembrance,</hi> to be <hi>ſorry</hi> for them, and to forſake them, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which <hi>that Sacrifice</hi> had not the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> intended by its <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> as is clear from the <hi>Scriptures</hi> above recited; it remains only to make it manifeſt, that <hi>Chriſt's Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion</hi> was a <hi>proper Expiatory Sacrifice for Sin,</hi> to ſhew theſe two things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>he</hi> purpoſely came to ſuffer <hi>Death</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> to the end that he might <hi>convert</hi> men thereby from their <hi>ſins</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> And <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:40186:187"/> That there is <hi>no Condemnation</hi> to thoſe that are ſo <hi>converted.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>Chriſt</hi> came on purpoſe into this World to die the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>Croſs</hi> for this very end, that he might turn Mens <hi>Hearts</hi> from <hi>Sin</hi> unto <hi>God,</hi> theſe following Texts of <hi>Sacred Writ</hi> will irrefragably (I doubt not) evince; When our <hi>Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> told his <hi>Diſciples</hi> of his Death near at hand, he ſaid, <hi>Now is my Soul troubled, and what ſhall I ſay? Father ſave me from this hour, but for this cauſe came I unto this hour,</hi> John 12. 27. And to what end came he unto it, but to <hi>deſtroy Sin</hi> by the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>himſelf</hi> upon the <hi>Altar</hi> of the Croſs, that Men might <hi>die unto Sin,</hi> and <hi>live unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> whoſe Fruit is <hi>everlaſting Life?</hi> for ſo the two <hi>chief Apoſtles</hi> plainly tell us; <hi>Now once in the end of the World hath he appeared to put away ſin by the Sacrifice of himſelf,</hi> Hebr. 9. 26. <hi>Who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own Body on the Tree, that we being dead to ſin ſhould live unto Righteouſneſs, by whoſe Stripes ye were healed,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24. <hi>Knowing this that our Old Man is crucified with him, that the Body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth we ſhould not ſerve ſin,</hi> Rom. 6. 6. <hi>That he died for all, that they which live ſhould

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>there is no Condemnation to thoſe who forſaking their ſins turn unto God,</hi> or that are <hi>converted</hi> from the <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> and worldly <hi>Vanities</hi> to the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> for the certainty of the truth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we have the <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>Truth it ſelf</hi> aſſuring us, <hi>He that hath my Commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40186:188"/> he that loveth me, ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifeſt my ſelf to him,</hi> John 14. 21. And a little after, <hi>If a Man love me, he will keep my Words, and my Father will love him, and we will come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and make our abode with him,</hi> Ver. 23. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> in expreſs words ſaith, <hi>There is therefore now no Condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. Nor is the truth of this Doctrine averred only by <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> but it is alſo evident to <hi>Human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> for ſince <hi>Sin is the privation of the due Love of God in the Soul through the inordinate Love of the World; (Sect. 8. Par.</hi> 2, 3, 4.) and that <hi>everlaſting Miſery is the neceſſary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the perpetual continuance in ſin after this Life, (Sect. 7. Par.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) 'tis as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly impoſſible that he who has <hi>forſaken</hi> the Love of the World for the Love of God ſhould eternally periſh, (unleſs he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe and die in mortal ſin, by leaving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Love of God for the Love of the World) as it is impoſſible that the ſame Man ſhould love the World <hi>above</hi> God, and God <hi>above</hi> the World both together to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

                  <p>For what end <hi>Christ died for us, ſuffered for us, bare our ſins in his own Body upon the Tree for us,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> it ſelf having expreſly ſhewn, (<hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>we being dead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sin ſhould live unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24.) there is no need for the explicating thoſe Expreſſions, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> either really <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred</hi> our <hi>ſins</hi> from <hi>us to himſelf;</hi> or <hi>took upon him the Puniſhment</hi> due to our <hi>ſins,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>perpetual Loſs of Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Pains of Hell;</hi> to aſſert any of which would be no leſs than <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi> 'Tis abundantly enough, that in regard <hi>Christ</hi> is Θεάνθρωπος, <hi>God-man,</hi> he underwent ſo much in behalf of Sinners, that his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible Sufferings</hi> are a truly <hi>meritorious (i. e.</hi> an efficacious efficient) <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from ſin,</hi> of <hi>juſtifying us,</hi> and of <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to Glory;</hi> which they <hi>effectually</hi> are to as many as through a vigorous <hi>Faith</hi> rightly weigh the <hi>Value</hi> of them, whilſt the <hi>due Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration</hi> of the immenſe and unmerited <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to Man, manifeſted chiefly in his <hi>bitter</hi> and <hi>ignominious</hi> Death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth Men to forſake all <hi>worldly Pleaſures</hi> for the <hi>Bleſſed Enjoyment</hi> of ſo gracious and ſtupendiouſly loving a <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as St <hi>Paul</hi> averreth, ſaying, <hi>For
